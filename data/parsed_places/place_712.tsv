Denton House McDonald's	['beautiful fast food', 'eccentric homes', 'homes', 'monuments']	210	537	"The appellation McMansion could certainly be applied here.
Long Island’s Denton House,  an 18th-century farmhouse that was converted into a Georgian-style mansion in the 1860s, houses perhaps the grandest McDonald’s restaurant on the planet.
Built in 1795 as a family dwelling, the house served a variety of functions over the years, including a funeral home and a string of restaurants. The building, however, fell into disrepair in the latter half of the 20th century. In 1985, McDonald’s purchased the property and planned to raze the structure, but residents of the town and the surrounding area intervened, hoping to save the building from the wrecking ball.
Under pressure from the preservationists, McDonald’s agreed to restore the home to its former grandeur in exchange for permission to build an addition for a drive-thru. And thus, the Denton House McDonald’s was born.
One of the highlights of the restaurant is the home’s veranda, which serves as a dining area and is sealed in with glass panelling. Even the drive-thru is unobtrusive and in keeping with the home’s overall appearance. This McDonald’s stands as a testament to what can be accomplished when a town’s residents band together to preserve their shared history."	This outpost of America's most popular fast-food restaurant is housed inside a palatial mansion.
