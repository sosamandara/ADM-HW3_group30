Musée des Arts Forains	['circus', 'collections', 'museums and collections', 'museums']	404	2630	"This museum of antique carnival objects invites you to ride on century-old carousels and experience the wonder of amusement attractions from 1850 to 1950. 
The museum, which opened in 1996, is sourced from the private collection of Jean-Paul Favand, an actor and dealer of antiquities. It includes such vintage carnival items as wooden carousels, fair stalls, German swings, and a Hooghuys Organ. Best of all, you can play a carnival game and even ride on some of the rides, such as the “Manège vélocipédique” from 1897, a carousel of bicycles powered by the pedaling of its riders. 
The museum is open only by reservation or by attending one of the scheduled seasonal tours."	A museum of carnival attractions where you are invited to ride the rides.
