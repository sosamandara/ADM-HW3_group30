Doullut Steamboat Houses	['houses', 'homes', 'architecture']	280	861	"New Orleans is known for its interesting architecture, but two of the most interesting homes are the Doullot Steamboat Houses located near the levee in the Holy Cross neighborhood of the Lower Ninth Ward, downriver from the French Quarter.
The homes were built in 1905 and 1913 by a steamboat captain and his son. They were built to look like steamboats, complete with smokestacks as chimneys. Despite being in the Lower Ninth Ward the houses survived Hurricane Katrina because the first floors are entirely ceramic inside and out."	A prime example of New Orleans' unique architecture these early 20th century homes were built to look like steamboats.
