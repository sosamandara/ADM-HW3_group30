Rattlesnake Ranch	['snakes', 'dinosaurs', 'roadside attractions', 'outsider art', 'sculptures', 'animals']	109	465	"Along a quiet stretch of E Dragoon Rd, about three miles from I-10, you’ll find a group of beautifully detailed sculptures guarding the entrance to Rattlesnake Ranch. Large handmade signs state “all snakes are protected here.”
An assortment of large sculptures sit just inside the entrance. There, both rusty and expertly painted dinosaurs mingle with a giant gila monster and a Native American on horseback. Farther away, a wild stallion poses in mid-leap.
The gate is often open during the day with a large welcome sign on it."	"Rusting dinosaurs frolic at the entrance to this roadside ""snake sanctuary."""
