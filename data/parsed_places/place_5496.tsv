Rosita's Bridge	['women', 'bridges', 'music']	858	496	"Mexican-American singer and actress Rosita Fernandez made a name for herself in the 1940s, 50s, and 60s by singing traditional songs from Mexico, helping to develop, transform, and popularize Tejano or “Tex-Mex” music.
Singing primarily ballads and love songs called corridos, Fernandez rose to fame in a time when Tejano music was a male-dominated genre.
Fernandez was born in Mexico and grew up and began her music career in San Antonio, Texas, where a lovely arched footbridge is named after the influential singer. Dedicated to Fernandez in 1982, “Rosita’s Bridge” extends over the San Antonio River near the Arnison River Theater stage where the singer performed on many occasions. Ivy grows along the sides of this stone structure as passenger barges and kayaks pass under. 
The bridge is far from the only way the Texas city has honored the Tejano singer. In addition to being elected to the Tejano Music Hall of Fame and San Antonio Music Hall of Fame, Rosita Fernandez was given the title of San Antonio’s “First Lady of Song” by Lady Bird Johnson."	An ivy-covered arch bridge dedicated to Tejano music singer and legend Rosita Fernandez.
