Honghe Hani Rice Terraces	['horticulture', 'unesco', 'landscapes', 'cultures and civilizations', 'ancient', 'plants']	33	463	"The stunning Honghe Hani Rice Terraces cover 1,000,000 acres from the slopes of the Ailao Mountains down to the Hong Kong River in Yunnan, China. 
The 1,200-year-old elaborate red rice terraces were created to bring water down from the forests to allow for farming on the slopes. The system of terraces stretches over four counties — Yuanyang, Honghe, Jinpin, and Lvchun — although the main area is in Yuanyang. 
Incorporated into the terraces are 82 villages, and a farming system involving buffaloes and cattle, as well as eels, ducks, and fish. 
The terraces were designated an UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2013."	A complex and beautiful system of rice terraces covers a million acres over the mountains.
