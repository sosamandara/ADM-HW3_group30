Crypt of Civilization	['time capsule', 'astounding timepieces', 'long now locations', 'repositories of knowledge', 'catacombs and crypts']	206	987	"The Crypt of Civilization at Oglethorpe University in Atlanta, Georgia, is widely considered to be the first conventional time capsule intended to be opened on a specific date in the future. That date is May 28, 8113.
If you accept the premise that the Egyptian Calendar, created in the year 4241 BC, marked the first fixed date in the history of man, then the year 1936, when the crypt was conceived, would represent the exact midpoint of recorded human history.
The crypt is 20’ x 10’ x 10’, sealed with a stainless steel door that has been welded shut. Its contents, inventoried at the crypt’s official website, include microfilms of 800 “authoritative books on every subject of importance known to mankind” and 200 works of fiction. Also:
