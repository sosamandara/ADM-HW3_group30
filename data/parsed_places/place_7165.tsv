Bellagio Patisserie Chocolate Fountain	['chocolate', 'food']	365	413	"When the Bellagio’s chocolate fountain was unveiled, the casino’s president boasted that it was “nothing short of genius.” In a mesmerizing display, liquid chocolate (dark, medium, and white) drizzled down the 27-foot-tall ode to sweet treats, only to be pumped to the top and drizzle down again. It stands outside the casino’s patisserie, and the Guinness Book of World Records certified it as the world’s largest chocolate fountain. 
Who’s their competition? As of 2019, a chocolate fountain in a Zurich Lindt store, which stands 30 feet tall. While this Swiss fountain has now been crowned the world’s largest, the Bellagio fountain remains in marvelous motion all day, every day."	Formerly the world's largest, this Willy Wonka-esque contraption runs 24/7.
