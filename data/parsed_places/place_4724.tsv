White Raven Trading Co. & The Museum of the Strange	['oddities', 'shops', 'museums']	105	509	White Raven Trading Co. Curiosity Shoppe and Museum of the Strange is a culmination of a lifelong obsession with the strange, unusual, and odd.  The Museum of the Strange is a free attraction featuring a collection of amazing “weird stuff.” It has everything from a reatwo-headed shark to the “world’s largest taxidermied frog band” to what’s probably the largest public display of “assquatches” (taxidermy deer butts). One of its most macabre items is a Charles Manson painting done in human blood, with some of his actual cremains mixed in, which is one of five of such paintings in existence.	This curiosity shop contains a museum filled with bizarre, unique objects.
