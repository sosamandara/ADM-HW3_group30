Hanny's	['buildings', 'restaurants']	275	572	"Hanny’s has an incredible past. The building was constructed in 1947 originally as a department store. After its closing, Hanny’s was purchased by the city and was used to train the city’s firefighters.
This building is now a fine dining restaurant, but has held onto much of its history. There are odd bathrooms, an empty elevator shaft made of glass, and basement access to view dolls leftover from the factory."	A former store turned restaurant with a few quirky additions.
