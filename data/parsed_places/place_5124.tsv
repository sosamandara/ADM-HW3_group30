St. Ignatius Hospital	['hospitals', 'abandoned']	98	531	"St. Ignatius Hospital operated from 1893-1964. During its early years, nurses treated patients in a wooden building on-site, as construction of the hospital wasn’t complete until 1894. The six-floor hospital only relied on donations and payments from patients rather than government assistance. This eventually created a financial struggle, leading to its closing.
The hospital was sold in 1968 and used as an assisted living facility until it was officially shut down and abandoned in 2000. In 2015, the building was added to the Most Endangered Properties list. It’s supposedly now a very haunted location with the ghosts of former patients reclaiming the halls."	An abandoned 19th-century hospital now swirling in ghost stories.
