Redmond Caves	['subterranean', 'caves', 'ecosystems']	125	525	"All over Oregon, there is evidence of ancient lava flows. Sometimes these volcanic flows create hollow tubes or caves. These caves can be anywhere from a few feet wide to hundreds of feet across.
Located in the city of Redmond, OR, the caves were once a single lava tube that partially collapsed, fed from the Newberry Caldera. Now, five caves exist and are open to exploration. The caves are also much larger than they first appear. Openings are low enough that you may need to duck, but there is plenty of room to stand and walk around once inside."	A sprawling cave network created by a lone lava tube.
