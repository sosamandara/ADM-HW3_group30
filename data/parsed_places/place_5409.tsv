Wizard Quest	['mazes', 'purveyors of curiosities', 'amusement parks', 'shops']	450	706	"Born from the kitsch-filled lands known as Wisconsin Dells, Wizard Quest is a unique theme attraction that lets visitors pick up a wand and magic their way through a surreal fantasy land.
Unlike most theme parks, Wizard Quest isn’t based around an existing intellectual property, but features an original story that leads people through the entire attraction. Covering 13,000 square feet of fantasy locales, the whimsical complex provides guests the chance to quest through their puzzling rooms in an attempt to free four elemental wizards, giving attendees the chance to play the hero. The quest takes nerds of any age through the “Quadrasphere” which includes rooms such as a hall of mirrors, numerous hidden passageways, and even traps! The adventure is played out through the use of a tablet, and optional blacklights that help you discover clues more quickly.
Despite the widespread rise of genre-culture in the past 20 years, Wizard Quest is still a one-of-a-kind attraction for fans wishing to visit an immersive world of fantasy and magic. For anyone sick of dreaming that they are Harry Potter, if you’re willing to suspend disbelief and ignore a little kitsch, this quest makes you your own hero.
Update as of August 2021: Wizard Quest has relocated to the 402 Broadway.  The Ripley’s Believe It Or Not Museum has expanded into the old Wizard Quest space."
