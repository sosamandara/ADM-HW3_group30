Villa Anita in Death Valley	['sculpture gardens', 'sculptures', 'art']	43	562	"Villa Anita is a non-profit museum and an organically growing, livable sculpture built from recycled materials packed full of fine furniture and a resident artist whose work tackles pressing social issues. The space is a labyrinth of carefully arranged living areas, sculptures, gardens, and lounging areas that make you feel like you’ve slipped into some alternate reality.  
Believe it or not, interesting spaces like this are kind of the norm for remote areas in this region, Salvation Mountain to the south, Thunder Mountain Monument to the north, but with Villa Anita, you get to see it as it becomes and speak directly with the artists, Carlo Roncancio, David Aaron Smith, Jack Holloman, and Katelyn Doherty.  You get to hear their stories, see their vision for the future, and strike up an appetite for other similar sites that dot the Mojave landscape."	This sculpture garden in Death Valley makes you feel like you've slipped into some alternate reality.
