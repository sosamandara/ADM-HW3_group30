World's Largest Plant Maze	['mazes', 'shops']	553	784	"Almost two and a half miles of paths weave through two acres of native plants to form the largest plant maze in the world. The current Guinness record holder, the Pineapple Maze at the Dole pineapple plantation had to expand in 2007 to win back the title.
The maze originally debuted in 1998, and now features more than 14,000 plants. It was designed as a game with eight stations to be visited, and a pineapple shaped garden at the center. The fastest times through the maze are posted on a sign at the entrance. For most visitors it takes about an hour, but the record time to complete this record maze is just seven minutes."	Race through the maze, get your name on the sign.
