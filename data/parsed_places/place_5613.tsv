Graffiti Alley - Ann Arbor	['alleyways', 'graffiti', 'art']	610	604	Tucked off of East Liberty Street in Ann Arbor, Michigan, is an alley covered in graffiti. The original graffiti space was painted over in 1999 with an original work by artist Katherine Cost titled Infinite Possibilities, but was defaced by local graffiti artists a few weeks later and entirely painted over within a few months. The alley remains a unique place for artists and has continued to evolve as new artists leave their mark.	An ever-evolving wall of graffiti art off East Liberty Street.
