The Zenith	['antiquities', 'restaurants', 'Unique Restaurants & Bars', 'collections']	195	887	"The Zenith is an antique shop and restaurant that also claims to be Pittsburgh’s oldest vegetarian eatery. Its unassuming façade hides a cornucopia of quirkiness within. Packed shelves and racks display collections of all sorts. Creepy dolls, teapots, religious statuettes, and decorative Dutch clogs are a few clusters that stand out. Mannequin heads peek from inside hutches. An assortment of owls adorns one of the bathrooms.
It’s hard to find an empty space on the walls, even the ceiling is taken. Prom dresses, a vacuum cleaner and a skeleton-angel are among the items that hang just above the visitors’ heads. For the fashion-oriented, there are vintage clothes, hats, shoes and jewelry. Sports fans will get a kick out of the shrine dedicated to Pittsburgh’s major teams (Pirates, Penguins, and Steelers).
The L-shaped dining room keeps the whimsical atmosphere going. No two tables are alike. Each one has its unique set of chairs, glasses, and silverware. Everything in the dining area can be purchased, too, including the table you may be sitting at. As you test out the furniture, sample the menu, as well, which gets updated regularly with fresh vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options. Dishes might include the likes of a seitan pot roast, a roasted eggplant hummus wrap, and a lentil burger. While they’re mostly vegan, some menu items may have cheese added to them, and eggs are served at brunch. The menu also features an extensive list of teas.
The Zenith triples as an art gallery, supporting local artists by housing their work."	This restaurant offers a side of antiques, curios, and a bathroom chock full of owls.
