Kendall Alley	['natural wonders', 'nature']	174	572	"Kendall Alley is one of the many cobblestone thoroughfares which snake through Old Town Pasadena’s commercial blocks, many of which feature hideaway bars, cafes, and even movie theater complexes. This particular alley, which looks much as it did in the 1930’s, has been featured in films such as Pulp Fiction, Paper Moon, Live Free or Die Hard, and The Sting.
The namesake of the alley is Bela Otis Kendall, a Pasadena real estate developer whose existing Old Town buildings include the Kinney Kendall Building on Colorado Boulevard, and the Auditorium on Union Street."	A cobblestone alley with an interesting past.
