Montemor-o-Novo Castle	['towers', 'castles', 'ruins']	113	414	"Dating back to the 13th century the ruins of the Montemor-o-Novo Castle in Portugal remain a haunting ruin that can be explored by any traveller curious enough to pass through the still-standing gates. 
In its day, the castle in Montemor-o-Novo was an impressive citadel perched on a hill.  It was inhabited by nobles and monarchs, but also used its long walls and fortified gates to protect the city itself. As the area grew, the palace eventually fell out of use and by the 16th century it stopped expanding and began its slow decline.
Today large portions of the castle remain including the gates to the city and portions of the walls. Most clearly are the number of towers that remain on the hill. An old clock tower and even a tall citadel strangely known as the “Tower of the Bad Hour” still rise up in front of the sky.
Visitors are welcome to roam the castle grounds and walk along the remaining portions of the walls and crumbling keeps. However the ruins are hundreds of years old and can be treacherous, so caution is advised."	This crumbling Portuguese ruin overlooks the populace it once ruled.
