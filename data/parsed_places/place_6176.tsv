Casa Goofy International	['naive art']	60	408	Since 1986, Casa Goofy has been a haven for travelers, artists, and transients. The property is strewn with industrial, post-apocalyptic metal yard art and clown-themed coffins, amongst other things. A massive dome covers the main house, but the volunteers who run the farm live in refurbished bread trucks, school buses, and shipping containers. The owner, Dennis, is a 79-year-old HVAC tech and former clown, often seen driving around town in a large yellow van painted like a banana spaceship. Youâ€™re welcome to explore the farm, meet the animals or even pitch in and help on a project.	This scrap yard doubles as a naive art gallery full of found art and farm animals.
