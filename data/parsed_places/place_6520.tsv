Floating Bridge of Brookfield, VT	['water']	255	861	"This floating bridge spans Sunset Lake buoyed by pontoons. The bridge, which is the only floating bridge east of the Mississippi River, was originally built in 1820 by Luther Adams and his neighbors.
Unfortunately, the floating bridge occasionally sinks and is currently closed due to damage. Itâ€™s been closed to car traffic since 2009 but you can still walk across it and picnic on its shores.
Repairs started in 2014 and it is due to open to traffic again in May 2015.
They said it would reopen in May 2015 and it has been reopened."	One car at a time please.
