Alvord Desert	['salt', 'environment', 'deserts', 'geology']	111	463	"Stepping onto the Alvord Desert will feel as though stepping onto a distant planet. Deep in the shadows of the towering Steens Mountain, it’s a place that’s hard to forget, with views stretching for miles in all directions. 
Thousands of years ago, a lake almost 200 feet deep covered the desert, leaving behind many of the salt minerals that comprise the desert today. On average, the Alvord only receives around seven inches of rain every year. 
Each season provides a very different experience in the desert. Cold temperatures dominate the winter months, while the spring is filled with sporadic rainfall. In the summer, the Alvord feels much more like a desert with dry air and little to no rainfall.
Nearby, the Alvord Hot Springs provide a stark contrast to the surrounding landscape. There are actually four other springs located around the desert region including Mickey Hot Springs, Tule Springs, Buckbrush Springs, and Borax Hot Springs. However, the Alvord is the only one you can actually get in and enjoy the waters. Wild horses sometimes come to the springs for a drink, a beautiful sight to witness."	At the base of Steens Mountain resides an otherworldly desert.
