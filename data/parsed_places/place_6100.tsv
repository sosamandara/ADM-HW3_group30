Focused on showing off art of this unique medium, the museum rotates items in its permanent collection including neon signs from the Brown Derby and Grauman’s Chinese Theatre. MONA also features numerous shows with the works of up-and-coming neon artists. Classes are offered for students to learn the skills of designing and building neon sculptures. 
In addition to its continuously changing exhibits, the museum also sponsors nighttime bus-tours of historic neon signs in the area. The museum has reopened in its new location in Glendale, California, with art exhibits, a gift shop, and lobby displays."
