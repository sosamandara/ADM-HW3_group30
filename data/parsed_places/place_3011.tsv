Moss Lady	['women', 'parks', 'sculptures', 'plants', 'art']	166	694	"Moss covers this giant sleeping woman like a snug green blanket. Flowering Crocosmia plants sprout from her head, giving her what looks like a spiky haircut speckled with colorful blossoms. The sculpture, which seems to blend effortlessly with the surrounding nature, is a beautiful piece of artwork to stumble upon.
The Moss Lady was constructed in 2015 and looks like she could be an identical twin to the Mud Maid in Cornwall’s Lost Gardens of Heligan. In fact, the Canadian version was directly inspired by the English artwork.
Artist Dale Doebert began crafting the colossal creation in Victoria’s Beacon Hill Park after seeing photographs of the famous English gardens. He and the city park staff used a whole concoction of boulders, pipes, cement, and wire to build the roughly 35-foot-long woman. Doebert then covered the sculpture with a specially designed clay-based acidic soil so moss could cloak his creation.
The peaceful expression on the sculpture’s face reflects the surroundings. A small stream gurgles nearby, making it seem like the woman was lulled to sleep by a watery lullaby. Carved wooden chairs and couches provide a calm resting spot for walkers who want to soak in the relaxing ambience."	Greenery cloaks this serene sculpture inspired by the famous Lost Gardens of Heligan.
