Wheeler Peak	['state high points', 'geographic markers', 'mountains']	242	407	"At least six mountains in the southwestern United States are named after George Montague Wheeler, who led expeditions to map the vast area. New Mexico’s Wheeler Peak is the highest point in the state at 13,167 feet above sea level.
Already leading expeditions in the area after the Civil War, Wheeler would survey the area for seven more years at the behest of Congress to explore the geology and exploit the natural resources of the region. The Wheeler survey began in 1872 to make a topographical map of the southwestern United States. The Survey’s photographs are now in the Library of Congress. The Survey and three others mapping the Sierra Nevada, Nebraska, and the Rocky Mountains would form the United States Geological Survey.
There are two standard routes to the summit of New Mexico’s Wheeler Peak: the gentle but 7.5 mile long Bull-of-the-Woods Trail, and the short but steep 3.5 mile Williams Lake Trail. Either trail can be accessed from the Taos Ski Valley resort. Follow either of these trails to a wide view of the country that Wheeler and his party explored almost 150 years ago."	This highest peak in New Mexico is named after an explorer who had a habit of lending his monicker to peaks.
