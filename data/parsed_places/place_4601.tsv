Longhorn Grill and Saloon	['abandoned mines', 'novelty architecture', 'roadside attractions', 'shops']	198	694	"Last known as the Longhorn Grill, the once-abandoned commercial space in Amado, Arizona has regained new life when it reopened in May 2019 as the Longhorn Grill and Saloon. The striking feature is the main entrance that has visitors walk through the nose of a giant longhorn skull, making it the most iconic buildings in the area. 
The building, which is sculpted to look like a colossal cow skull resting against a huge boulder, was built in the 1970s by an enterprising entrepreneur who clearly knew the power of both novelty architecture and giant skulls. While it previously was most recently a restaurant, the building had actually been a bait shop, a clothing store, and a roofing company. Although none of those businesses seemed as appropriate for the space as the steakhouse it became in 1993.
The Longhorn Grill operated until 2012, when it finally faced foreclosure and had to be sold at auction. As late as 2013, the space was said to have been used for parties and the like until it was renovated an reopened in 2019. It now serves breakfast through dinner, 7 days a week.
Despite its rough past, the proud Western roadside icon remains to this day, and even thrives under the new ownership. The concrete, rebar, and stucco that the 30-foot tall horns are made of continues to hold up despite years under the Arizona sun, and the full restoration work on the interior makes an impressive and comfortable place to stop. Feel free to take your picture in front of the skull."	This giant steer-skull edifice refuses to die.
