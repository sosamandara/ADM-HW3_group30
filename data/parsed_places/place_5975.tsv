Before coming to its final resting place within this hidden-in-plain-site treasure trove of adventurous objects, it once sailed the entire 4,258-mile length of the Nile river. Its occupant, John Goddard, was the first person to ever complete the journey.
A vast collection of artifacts, such as a shrunken head, Pre-Columbian pottery, a quiver of poison spears, a clay pot containing human remains, a stuffed polar bear, a mammoth skull, the autographed helmet of a member whose bombing raid on Japan helped alter the course of World War II, can found at the club’s headquarters in LA’s Lincoln Heights.
Established in 1922 by Captain John Roulac, the club has gathered for the past 95 years to share their extraordinary expeditions. Currently, they have over 100 members from a wide variety of professions including scientists, journalists, artists, doctors, pilots, archaeologists, soldiers, mountaineers, hunters, and astronauts. The members’ travels have taken them to the most remote corners of the world and beyond, and their harrowing experiences have lead to remarkable discoveries.
Although founded as a “Gentlemen’s Club” Ladies Nights are showing up on the calendar with increased frequency (almost every meeting) and the club never turns guests away. We hope membership will soon be open to all, regardless of gender."	Hidden above a drug store on a nondescript corner of Lincoln Heights is a private clubhouse for intrepid explorers.
