Fort Pike	['natural wonders', 'nature']	321	1265	"Named for the explorer soldier Zebulon Montgomery Pike, Fort Pike was built to defend the city of New Orleans from invasion by sea.
Like nearby Fort Macomb, Fort Pike was built as part of the country’s “Third System” of seacoast defenses built in the years following the War of 1812.
Fort Pike was the third building constructed of the 42 eventually completed. Originally home to mighty sea-facing cannons, the impressive structure was abandoned in 1890 without ever firing her cannons in battle, and now stands empty and unarmed as a state historic site.
Badly damaged in Hurricane Katrina, the site had been reopened to the public – but due to further damage incurred during Tropical Storm Isaac in 2012, the site is currently off limits."	Once defending the city of New Orleans from invasion by sea, this fort faces an uncertain future.
