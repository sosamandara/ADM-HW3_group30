Copper Creek Falls and Mine	['wwi', 'mines', 'abandoned']	101	755	"Just a moderate hiking distance from the main road of the affluent community of San Elijo outside San Diego, lie the remains of an old copper mine dating back to the early 1900s.
There are several stone ruins scattered around the area, mounds of decades-old copper tailings, and the original dam used by the miners to clean their lode prior to hauling it out. You can stand among the overgrown vegetation and get a sense of the Encinitas Mining Company operation that became one of the largest active copper mines during World War I and was crucial to the war effort.  
The century-old tailings are piled up and the copper dust has an amazing natural oxidized patina. There are endless picturesque scenes along the trail leading up to the ruins. Take time to smell the proverbial roses as the scenery is stunning."	The overgrown ruins of a once thriving World War I-era copper mine.
