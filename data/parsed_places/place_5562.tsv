Showa Daibutsu: The Great Showa Buddha of Seiryuji	"['giant buddhas', ""world's tallest"", 'monuments', 'statues', 'sacred spaces']"	54	634	"Located in Aomori, at the Seiryuji (Blue-Green Dragon) Temple is a colossal likeness of Dainichi Nyorai completed in 1984. This particular Buddha, known primarily as Vairocana in the sanskrit, is the principal deity of the esoteric Shingon sect of Buddhism. This particular Daibutsu is the tallest seated bronze statue of the Buddha in Japan, taller even than the famous Daibutsu of Nara.
Shingon Temples hold light ceremonies during the Bon Festival, in mid-August, to help those in a liminal state between life and death successfully transmigrate. Often, during this time, parents of a recently departed child will pray for the pacification of their own souls, and for that of the childâ€™s. The Seiryuji Temple is no different in this respect, holding grand light ceremonies for the entirety of the Bon Festival."	The tallest bronze seated statue of the Buddha in Japan.
