Jeju Loveland	['outsider art']	116	414	"Korea’s only sexual theme park, Jeju Loveland was created in 2004 by 20 artists who graduated from Honglk University in Seoul. The exhibition halls that house the gift shop and gallery of the park are modeled after traditional Korean architecture, but very little else is of a “traditional” nature in this park.
Bulkkeuni (a phallus wearing yellow mittens) and Saekkeuni (a vagina modeling a floppy hat and bow), the park’s mascots, welcome visitors through the front gates. The restrooms adhere to the sexual theme as well: two breasts for handles on the men’s door, and an erect penis as a doorknob for the women’s door.
The outdoor theme park features 140 sculptures representing humans in various sexual positions.
After the Korean War, the island became a popular honeymoon destination for Korean couples, due to the island’s warm climate. Many of the couples had wed because of arranged marriages, and the island also became known for being a center of sex education.
Visitors are required to be at least 18 years old, and a separate play area is available for minors while adults visit.
Update as of September 2022: The location is closed indefinitely."	South Korea's only sex-themed park.
