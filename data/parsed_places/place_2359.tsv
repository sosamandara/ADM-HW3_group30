Séance Room at Muriel's Jackson Square	['ghosts', 'haunted', 'death', 'restaurants']	521	2131	"New Orleans is no stranger to paranormal activity and or classic Creole fare. Muriel’s Jackson Square just happens to serve a generous helping of both.
At this French Quarter restaurant, patrons dine amongst the spirits of New Orleans’s past. Before serving up plates of goat cheese crepes, the building was believed to have served as a holding facility for slaves being put up for auction in the early 1700s. Then, in 1788, the Great New Orleans Fire partially destroyed the original building. The new owner, Pierre Antoine Lepardi Jourdan, spent several years restoring the property and transforming it into a home for his family. In 1814, he lost his beloved home in a game of poker. Rather than be forced to vacate the house, he died by suicide on the second floor. 
In 2001, after several changes in ownership, Muriel’s Jackson Square opened its doors to the public, while maintaining the original design of the building. The owners converted the second floor into a séance room, where the ghost of Jourdan is believed to spend most of his time.
Patrons and employees of Muriel’s have reported seeing the sudden shattering of glasses and objects moving around the room, and hearing unidentified voices on the second floor. The owners of the establishment maintain that the spirits present in the building are completely harmless and even entertaining. They welcome the spirits of the building to dine with them harmoniously and even reserve a table for the spirit of Mr. Jourdan every night, complete with an offering of wine and bread."	The restaurant keeps a hidden séance room on the second floor and reserves a table for the spirit of the former owner each night.
