Intuit: The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art	['outsider art', 'museums and collections']	434	1426	"Established in 1991, Intuit: The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art is the only nonprofit organization in the United States that is dedicated solely to presenting self-taught and outsider art — with world class exhibitions; resources for scholars and students; a Permanent Collection with holdings of more than 1,100 works of art; the Henry Darger Room Collection; the Robert A. Roth Study Center, a non-circulating collection with a primary focus in the fields of outsider and contemporary self-taught art; and educational programming for people of all interest levels and backgrounds.
Exhibitions: In its two galleries, Intuit presents a minimum of four world-class exhibitions every year featuring emerging and established self-taught, visionary and outsider artists with works drawn from Intuit’s Permanent Collection or from prominent collections worldwide. In 2010, Intuit hosted the traveling exhibit, The Treasure of Ulysses Davis, which was organized by the High Museum of Art, Atlanta.
Intuit is a strong presence in Chicago’s cultural patrimony, being voted “Best Gallery” by the readership of the Chicago Reader in 2008 and 2009. The Picture Tells The Story: The Drawings of Joseph E. Yoakum was selected as one of the “Top Art and Design Shows of 2009” by Time Out Chicago, which also named the Henry Darger Room Collection as a “Development that Changed Chicago Art and Design Forever.”
Henry Darger Room Collection: A permanent installation of the artist’s worn furniture, Remington typewriter, religious objects and numerous artifacts from his life. Included are personal documents, his source materials and architectural elements, fixtures and features from Darger’s own room. This evocation, offering a window into this reclusive artist’s personal environment, seeks to enhance the understanding and appreciation of Henry Darger and was cited as “One of the Top 10 Chicago Art Stories of the Decade,” by Chicago Public Radio.
Robert A. Roth Study Center: A non-circulating collection with a primary focus in the fields of outsider and contemporary self-taught art. Our holdings contain an extensive and growing library of books, catalogs, periodicals, slides, photographs, monographs, videotapes and CDs, and other ephemera and archive materials. As a public resource that complements our educational mission, Intuit’s study center is open to students and scholars. Visitors can schedule an appointment or browse our holdings online.
Educational Programming: Intuit offers an exciting array of public programming for adults and students including lectures, workshops, performances and films. Tours and group visits to Intuit include: an introduction to Intuit, an overview of self-taught and outsider art, and a tour of current exhibitions.
