Brain Sculpture	['medical museums', 'sculptures']	275	435	"The Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at Indiana University is now home to the world’s largest anatomically-accurate brain sculpture. Made entirely of Indiana limestone and mounted on a stainless-steel plate, the 10,000-pound brain rises seven feet from the ground in the courtyard outside the department’s entrance. 
The sculpture was designed by Bloomington artist Amy Brier in conjunction with limestone carver Mike Donham and his team at Accent Limestone. This extraordinary work was underwritten by the Harlan Family Foundation and was unveiled as part of the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences’ 125th anniversary celebration as a monument to the department’s longstanding history of scientific study."
