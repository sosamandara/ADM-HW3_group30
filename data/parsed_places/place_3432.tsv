George Glazer Gallery	['globes', 'purveyors of curiosities', 'maps', 'shops']	193	1538	"The George Glazer Gallery is an antiquarian shop located in New York City. Opened by George Glazer in 1993, the gallery is consistently rated as one of the best antique specialty shops in New York. A former lawyer, Glazer left the legal profession to pursue his passion of collecting antique globes and maps. Now, almost three decades later, his expertise in the field of globes and cartography is recognized by museums worldwide.
The gallery and its eccentric owner have been featured on numerous television programs including episodes of “Martha Stewart Living” and PBS’s antiques show “Find!” Pieces from the gallery have appeared in magazine and newspaper articles nationwide and are often chosen as centerpieces by professional decorators.
The gallery maintains an extensive online portfolio of the items that are for sale. A photo of each piece is accompanied by an extensive history of the item thoroughly researched by the staff. Online are also Glazer’s thoughts on the history of collecting entitled “The Art of Collecting.” It is here that the grand sweep of history as told by the many pieces in the gallery is fully told.
Visiting the store has been described as being akin to wandering in the world’s coolest attic, with a wondrous array of globes and celestials surrounding those lucky enough to discover this quiet little shop."	Unique antiquarian shop specializing in globes, maps, and prints.
