The School Bus Graveyard	['gallery', 'graveyards', 'transportation', 'outsider art', 'cemeteries', 'collections', 'art']	331	1112	"Where does a school bus go to die? Usually, it winds up in a junk yard to sit, rust, and rot. But in a small town in northern Georgia, some retired buses begin new lives as quirky pieces of art.
The School Bus Graveyard in Alto, Georgia, turns junk into creative gems. Each year, artists transform the busesâ€™ signature yellow exteriors and give the vehicles a makeover. Old buses, trucks, and RVs become a canvas for murals that come alive with bright colors and whimsical designs.
The property is owned by Alonzo Wade, who runs an auto parts shop. After people began stealing scraps and material in the early 2000s, neighbors suggested he use his array of salvaged buses and trucks to form a fence.
Not only did the wall help deter thieves, it also acted as a beacon for local creatives searching for an unconventional canvas. A team of artists known as Crispy Printz began painting the buses in 2012. They invite other artists to come repaint them every year, so the designs are constantly changing."
