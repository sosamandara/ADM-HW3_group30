Peppersauce Cave	['hiking', 'underground', 'lakes', 'caves', 'natural wonders', 'ecosystems', 'water', 'nature']	55	505	"Accessible only by hiking in and marked only by a kiosk with a map below the cave, Peppersauce Cave feels very different from better-known cave systems that feature guided tours, parking lots, and paths with handrails. A thirteen-month project by volunteers in 2017-2018 removed all of the graffiti in the cave. Efforts are ongoing to keep the cave clean.
The cave is located in the Coronado National Forest north of Tucson, Arizona. A 1948 article in The Desert Magazine brought the site, which was reportedly discovered by deer hunters, to the attention of the wider public. You can still see wonders described in the article, including an underground lake, which is the main draw for many visitors, and a rock “slide.” Ropes and ladders are set up inside to help those exploring get around without needing professional equipment.
If you visit, prepare to get dirty and explore an environment that can get very hot and humid. The entrance to the cave is just past the map posted on the trail and, while small, opens up to a large room. Pens and a notebook have been placed in the Big Room so you can make a record of your visit while preserving this amazing cave experience. 
Please respect this natural landmark. Take trash with you and please do not place graffiti in or around the cave."	An off-the-beaten path cave with an underground lake.
