Kjeragbolten	['rocks', 'geological oddities', 'natural wonders', 'geology', 'nature']	98	847	"Hidden in the Norwegian mountains, Kjeragbolten is a place that looks like something from Middle Earth.
Kjeragbolten is a boulder wedged in a mountain crevasse by the edge of the Kjerag mountain in Lysefjord, near Stavanger. You might have seen it in one of the “Where the Hell is Matt” videos, which feature a man doing a crazy dance in dozens of locations around the world.
The boulder itself is a five-cubic-meter large block of stone suspended above 984-meter deep abyss. Despite its impressive appearance, it is easily accessible on foot without any special equipment. The whole of Kjerag mountain is a popular hiking area, and Kjeragbolten is a favorite photo spot.
Apparently, for some the thrill of standing on a boulder suspended between two cliffs isn’t quite enough, as Kjeragbolten has become a very popular spot for base jumpers to use when launching themselves into the air.
The hike up can be somewhat challenging for non-experienced hikers. It is not appropriate for small children. Good hiking shoes/boots are recommended. Also, bring plenty of water and sunscreen, as there are no trees to shelter under on the mountains."	This giant boulder is pinched over a 1000-meter abyss by two mountains.
