Aetherius Society's American Headquarters	['aliens', 'sacred spaces']	74	432	"“Co-operating with the Gods from Space”
Founded by Master of Yoga Dr. George King, the Aetherius Society is an international spiritual organization. On May 8, 1954, Dr. King received a message from Aetherius, an extraterrestrial intelligence, stating, “Prepare yourself! You are to become the voice of Interplanetary Parliament.” Over the course of the next 43 years, Dr. King received and recorded over 600 communications that have come to be known as the “Cosmic Transmissions,” a set of teachings dedicated to the healing and enlightenment of humanity.
The Society has two headquarters located in London and Los Angeles as well as several branches and groups around the world. Dr. King passed away in 1997, but his legacy is alive and strong and his followers continue to practice the teachings delivered by the Cosmic Masters."	"""Prepare yourself!
