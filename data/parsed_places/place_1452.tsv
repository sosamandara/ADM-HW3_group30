Municipal House	['art nouveau', 'architecture']	974	555	"This absolutely beautiful building opened in 1912 houses a concert venue, three restaurants, the oldest bar in Prague, and some of the most beautiful art nouveau architecture around. It also frequently hosts exhibits such as pieces from Museum of Decorative Art.
Obecní dům (Municipal House) stands on the site of the former Royal Court Palace, the King’s residence between 1383 and 1485.  The palace was abandoned and then demolished in the 20th century. The current Art Nouveau building was built between 1905 and 1912. The mosaic over the entrance is called Homage to Prague made by Karel Špillar. Probably  the most impressive is the Mayor’s Hall decorated with Alphonse Mucha’s  painting. The paintings depict notable historical figures, such as Jan Hus (1369-1415), Czech priest, philosopher and early Christian reformer; the Hussite general Jan Žižka (1360-1424), follower of Jan Hus; and the Hussite King Jiří of Poděbrady (1420-1471). The circular ceiling fresco is called The Slavic Concord.
The halls part of the guided tour: Smetana Hall, Confectionery, Moravian Slovak Parlour, Božena Němcová Parlour, Oriental Parlour (Serbian room), Grégr Hall, Palacký Hall, Mayor’s Hall, Riegr Hall, Sladkovský Hall.
In 1918 it was the scene of the proclamation of the new independent state of Czechoslovakia."	A turn of the century building boasting some of the most beautiful art nouveau architecture in Prague.
