National Bobblehead Hall of Fame and Museum	['dolls', 'toys', 'sports', 'collections', 'museums']	112	462	"At the world’s only museum entirely dedicated to bobbleheads, you can learn about the history of this singular head-nodding doll, browse through the thousands of bobbleheads that are on display, and even design a custom oversized plastic head in your own likeness. 
While the bulk of the collection is sports figures, you will also see the wobbling heads of cartoon characters, pop-culture icons, celebrities, politicians, and even a six-foot-tall, life-sized bobblehead.
The museum has been open since February 2019, but the co-founders, Brad Novak and Phil Sklar, have been collecting bobbleheads since 2002. Once they announced plans to open a museum, bobblehead collectors began adding to the assortment. Today the collection numbers more than 10,000 bobbleheads, with some 6,500 currently on display at the Milwaukee museum."	This quirky museum has a collection of more than 10,000 bobblehead dolls.
