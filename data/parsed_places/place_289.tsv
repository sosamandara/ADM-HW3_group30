Vancouverâ€™s Japadog hot dog stands started operations in 2005 and provide an interesting take on traditional American hot dogs, with Asian offerings like the misomayo (a turkey dog topped with sesame sauce, radish sprouts, and wasabi mayo) and terimayo (a beef dog topped with seaweed, grilled onions, teriyaki sauce, and wasabi mayo).
Vancouver is an international city, and Japadog is a tasty reflection of its heritage and history."	Surprisingly Delicious Asian-Style Hot Dogs.
