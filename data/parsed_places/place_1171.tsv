Suspended Houses of Pont-en-Royans	['cliffs', 'architectural oddities', 'architecture']	88	544	"Built in the 16th century, the multi-story homes in the village of Pont-en-Royans, France, sit on top of and hang over the edge of the natural Vercors cliffs.  
It appears that the ground beneath many of the homes in this village has been eroded away, leaving them to hang perilously over thin air. But in reality, the buildings were intentionally built over the precipice.
This unusual choice was made to maximize the plateau’s limited space, as the site was established to facilitate a bustling wood trade. Now, the community sees most of its income from tourism, as people from around the world flock to the tiny town to witness the audaciously pendulous architecture."	These quaint French houses dangle precariously over a precipice.
