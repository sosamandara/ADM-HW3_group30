Street Performers of Las Ramblas	['performances', 'cities', 'statues', 'art']	1902	466	"While walking down Las Ramblas in Barcelona, it’s quite normal to see the head of a chef in a pizza, an angel, a man covered in scrap, a demoness from mythology, a moving skeleton on a bicycle, Galileo Galilei, or a man on a toilet, not to mention a levitating Satan, people coated in mud, a guy who has lost his head, a devil in the trunk, and the Grim Reaper.
Once the site of a monastery and a university, the stretch is now Barcelona’s busking center. Human statues, who patiently transform themselves into mythical creatures or famous figures from history with the help of elaborate makeup and attire, spend hours frozen in place, or break the position to perform for and interact with the gathered crowds.
This iconic boulevard, stretching for a nearly a mile, is the perfect stage for street performers to capture the attention of tourists and locals with their quirky costumes and acts. While strolling along and watching this live art unfold, visitors can also walk across a piece of art by the famous Spanish artist Joan Miró, a huge circular street mosaic in the primary colors. It was created in 1967, and restored by the government for its 30th anniversary."	The iconic boulevard is the perfect place to catch sight of a bicycling skeleton, a levitating Satan, or a chef with his head stuck in a pizza.
