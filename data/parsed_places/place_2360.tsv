World's Largest Cuckoo Clock	"['mechanical instruments', 'machines', 'clocks', ""world's largest""]"	313	684	"The cuckoo clock in Triberg-Schonach chimes twice an hour. Each time, the call comes from pipes 13 feet long. 
This is the world’s largest cuckoo clock, a distinction it has held since 1997. It has become the main draw of Germany’s Eble Uhren-Park. 
Local clockmakers Ewald and Ralf Eble showcased their mastery of the craft in the creation of this massive cuckoo clock. They followed century-old blueprints to build a clock using traditional Black Forest craftsmanship—but 60 times the size. The dimensions are impressive: The clockwork is 15 feet tall and weighs six tons. The cuckoo itself weighs 330 pounds, and the swinging pendulum is 26 feet long.
Just like the smaller traditional models, the world’s biggest cuckoo clock has one weight to drive the pendulum and another to drive the cuckoo. Constructing the giant timepiece required a great deal of precision and mastery. Given its unprecedented size, every piece needed to be custom-made. Visitors are able to walk inside the clock to see the impressive mechanics in action. 
The world’s largest cuckoo clock was completed in 1994 after five years of construction. It earned a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records three years later and has held the title ever since."
