Kalaloch Tree of Life	['beaches', 'native americans', 'trees', 'natural wonders', 'plants']	259	869	"Also known as the Tree Root Cave, this giant spruce has survived despite erosion tearing away at its foundation. When you first see the tree, you’ll notice that despite its visible roots, its foliage remains as vibrant as ever. Beneath the roots is a small cave that plays host to a stream that carries out to the Pacific Ocean.
The tree is located in the Kalaloch Campground, near the Kalaloch Lodge. Thick, winding roots are how the tree clings to the coastal bluff beneath it. A stream flows through the cave, preventing any sediment from rebuilding around the roots and slowing widening the gap that lies underneath the tree."	This large Sitka spruce that appears to be floating in mid-air, has defied logic for years.
