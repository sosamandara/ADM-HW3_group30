Concrete Parthenon	['architectural oddities', 'museums and collections', 'architecture']	3015	1534	"Originally constructed for Tennessee’s 1897 Centennial Exposition, a full-sized replica of Athens’ famous Parthenon resides today in Nashville’s Centennial Park. Its most remarkable quality is that it’s made entirely of concrete after originally being constructed from wood and plaster as a temporary structure. The building also houses a 42-foot recreation of the Parthenon’s Athena statue. The statue, crafted by Alan LeQuire, is the largest indoor sculpture in the western world. As per Nashville’s Parks and Recreation website, “The building and the Athena statue are both full-scale replicas of the Athenian originals.”
The Parthenon is a destination unto itself, but also serves as one of the city’s top art installations. The focus of its permanent collection is a group of 19th and 20th-century paintings by American artists, donated by James M. Cowan. A variety of temporary shows and exhibits can also be found in the additional gallery space. Surrounded by a 130-acre park that is popular for many leisure activities and marks the beginning of the historic Natchez Trace."	This replica of the Greek structure is in the heart of Nashville.
