Miamisburg Mound	['catacombs and crypts']	426	726	"The Miamisburg Mound is a large Native American conical burial mound constructed by the culture that archaeologists refer to as Adena. Â The mound is almost 70 feet tall and is virtually intact. Visitors can climb to the top of the mound via a concrete staircase.
The mound tomb was constructed approximately 2500 years ago as one of many similar mound earthworks. Excavations in 1869 revealed a bark-covered skeleton and a chamber located 28 feet deep into the mound, but the chamber was found to be empty.
The Adena people flourished between 1000-200 BC and established their homes across what is now Ohio, Indiana, West Virginia, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and New York. There are several burial mounds and an estimated 200 other Adena-related sites scattered throughout their territory.
The Miamisburg Mound is in a local park and is a designated Ohio Historical Site."	The largest ancient burial mound in Ohio.
