Forest of Dean Sculpture Trail	['stained-glass windows', 'trails', 'forests', 'ecosystems', 'sculptures', 'art']	99	627	"The Forest of Dean is a magical place, and it’s no wonder it’s said to have inspired Tolkien’s elven kingdom. It’s easy to let your imagination run wild as you walk deeper among the ancient trees that tower above you. A fantastical sculpture trail winds through the forest, adding to its enchanting ambiance.
Of all the artwork sprinkled throughout the woods, one of the most mesmerizing pieces is a stained glass window called “Cathedral,” by artist Kevin Atherton. The colorful window dangles among the trees, supported by wooden beams that form the skeleton of a building.
Natural light dances through the window, igniting its splendid colors and dappling the surrounding woodland. As you step back to admire it, you’ll truly feel as if you’re in a forest cathedral, complete with walls of trees, a lush ceiling of leaves, and of course, the stained glass art that celebrates the natural world.
“Cathedral” is but one part of the Forest of Dean Sculpture Trail. The trail was established in 1986, and has hosted a medley of permanent and temporary exhibits ever since. The blend of small and oversized art pieces both blend into the forest and stand out. Each piece is unique and is worth stopping to admire."	On this wooded path, a stained-glass window creates a spellbinding forest cathedral.
