M*A*S*H Filming Location	['korean war', 'television', 'medicine', 'film locations', 'mountains', 'nature']	218	560	"It’s been more than three decades since Hawkeye Pierce and his group of doctors, nurses, and soldiers bid the small screen adieu. But nostalgic M*A*S*H fans can still visit the real-world site of the Korean army medical camp where the beloved show was set.
The show’s Korean camp set was created on a movie ranch owned by 20th Century Fox, situated in the Santa Monica mountains. For over a decade, between 1972 and 1983, most scenes were shot at this location. The site was later donated by the studio and became a part of the Malibu Creek State Park, with multiple hiking trails running through the M*A*S*H locations. 
Several years after the filming stopped, the props left behind were rusted, overgrown, and almost unrecognizable. A partial restoration in 2007 ensured that the trucks, vans, and tables used in the series were cleaned up, and information boards with photographs were added. A path was cleared to reach the helicopter landing site seen on the series. Even without the M*A*S*H connection, the hike is popular for its stunning mountain trails. 
Update: As of November 12th, 2018, Malibu Creek State Park is closed until further notice due to the damage caused by the Woolsey Fire.
Update: As of September 17, 2019, the Malibu Creek State Park is alerting visitors that winter flooding damaged the bridge leading to the M*A*S*H set. Those visiting Century Lake to see the set should use an alternate route on the right side of the bridge, about 100 feet away. It’s advised that those with balance issues avoid the alternative route."	The show's fictional Korean medical camp was created in the Santa Monica hills.
