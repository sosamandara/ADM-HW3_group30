Ely's Peak and DWP Railroad Tunnel	['tunnels', 'subterranean sites']	85	497	"When you just round a bend on the DWP (Duluth, Winnipeg and Pacific Railway) Trail you’ll encounter a massive surprise; an old railroad tunnel excavated more than a century ago. The out-of-use tunnel is now part of a multi-purpose trail around Ely’s Peak. Expect to share the path with bikers, hikers, and runners. Don’t be surprised to hear a few screams as people encounter each other in the dark. The tunnel is also a popular spot for rock climbers. 
Along the DWP Trail are great spots for viewing the St. Louis River and western Duluth. The trail is a gentle one, made for biking or walking. Climb to the top of Ely’s Peak for even more spectacular views."	A spooky defunct railroad tunnel now part of a sprawling trail.
