Bryant Park Bathroom	['bathrooms', 'parks', 'architectural oddities', 'architecture']	867	1372	"Think of public bathrooms, and the mind conjures images of grimy walls, wet floors, and stinky, dirty toilets. But you won’t find any of those features in this Beaux-Arts building, which hides a rare restroom oasis. 
The building is home to what may be the most luxurious public bathroom in all of New York City. Funded by private donors, these tiny toilets (with only two stalls for men and three for women) offer those with full bladders an unusually pleasant public bathroom experience. 
Guests are greeted by fresh flowers, paintings of the park made by artists-in-residence, and even bathroom attendants, all set to a background of curated classical music. Large frosted glass windows let light gently spill into the space. The toilets, sinks, and other fixtures are the same luxury brand used at the MoMA.
The building, which is a historic landmark, underwent a roughly $300,000 renovation in 2017. It’s clear the donors weren’t flushing funds down the toilet, as pedestrians seem to appreciate the upscale commode.
It’s been said that park employees are regularly sent to scout out bathrooms in the Waldorf Astoria, the Plaza, the St. Regis, and other luxury locations to scope out the competition. Anyone with a taste for luxury is free to make use of the toilets, though be forewarned, lines to get in can be pretty long."	The fanciest public restroom in New York City boasts fresh flowers, art, and a classical music soundtrack.
