Sarris Candies Factory	['chocolate-covered', 'chocolate', 'food art', 'ice cream', 'candy', 'factories']	223	521	"Frank Sarris started the Sarris Candies Company in his basement in 1960. Today, its factory in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, still makes regionally beloved chocolates. Along with its boxed assortments and chocolate-covered pretzels, the Sarris factory is also famous for another treat: a 1,500-pound chocolate castle.
The detailed, colorful castle gets rebuilt a few times each year, with seasonal themes. The entire confection is edible, right down to the mini carousel. If viewing the beautiful confection—or one of the other chocolate sculptures occasionally on display—whets your appetite, the factory has an adjacent candy store. 
In the 1980s, Sarris expanded the candy store to include an old-fashioned ice cream parlor serving sundaes and floats. In addition to hot fudge and strawberries, the shop also uses its own candy to top its sundaes. After a server pours melted milk or dark chocolate over the cold ice cream, it cools into a hard cap on top."	Nothing says indulgence like a 1,500-pound chocolate castle.
