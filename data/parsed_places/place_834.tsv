Peep Show at Carroll Arts Council	['candy', 'holidays', 'food']	125	471	"Every year, in the weeks leading up to Easter, the Carroll Arts Council in Westminster, Maryland, hosts a peep show. No, not that kind of peep show. A Marshmallow PEEP show.
Approximately 100 teams work year-round to create a Marshmallow Peep masterpiece made primarily out of the delicious Easter candy, which are displayed in the old Westminster Theater for thousands of patrons’ viewing pleasure, and the chance to be voted the best of the best.
Some of the popular choices include larger-than-life sugary versions of Belle from Beauty and the Beast, a Game of Thrones dragon, R2D2, Edgar Allen Poe, The Rainbow Fish, and Paddington Bear."	Easter in Westminster may be the only time and place to behold Edgar Allen Poe made entirely of Marshmallow Peeps.
