Berlin Story Bunker	['torture museums', 'horror', 'bunkers', 'military history', 'military', 'museums']	372	1199	"When it was built in 1943, this large bunker building was meant to connect to an underground supply rail while troops waited out bombardment. But its thick concrete walls, the bunker did not see much action, as the war ended a scant few years later. But the building remained, and today its serves as a documentation of the Nazi regime (and oddly, some floors serve as a haunted house attraction).
The first floor of the complex houses the bunker museum. This display features clippings, photos, and other ephemera from the World War II era. Many of the spare furnishings also remain giving visitors a sense of what bunker life might have been like.
The second floor begins to get more gruesome with a multi-room exhibition on medicine and torture throughout the ages including displays regarding amputation, cannibalism, and animal-to-human blood transfusions. The third floor gives up any educational pretense, and simply contains a year-round haunted house with black light rooms and jump scares.
World War II history and cheap scares might be a pretty strange fit but it is one war museum where they wear their horrors on their bloody sleeve."	This World War II bunker now survives as a documentation of the Nazi regime and war crimes.
