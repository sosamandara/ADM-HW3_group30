Commercial Street Cat Village	['cats', 'animals']	122	633	"A colony of feral cats can be found on Commercial Street, living in and around a series of blue wooden boxes.
Installed and maintained by a non profit group and program called “neighborhood cats” (neighborhoodcats.org) which practices the “TNR” method of feral animal population control. (Trap, Neuter, Release is what the acronym TNR stands for.) The feral population is kept stable via this humane and pragmatic practice, versus capturing and culling, and spares the lives of these street cats.
In return, the cats keep the rodent population at bay all across the Greenpoint waterfront."	Feral cats keeping the rodent population at bay all across Greenpoint waterfront.
