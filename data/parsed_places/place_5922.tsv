Trilobite Quarry	['natural history', 'natural wonders', 'collections', 'nature']	184	1391	"Nestled in a remote valley known as the Wheeler Amphitheater, this family-owned quarry has been in operation for nearly fifty years, Featuring the vast trove of Cambrian period invertebrates, the Wheeler Shale is to arachnomorph arthropods as the Burgess Shale is to soft-bodied invertebrates.
This quarry is one of the densest deposits ofÂ  Cambrian trilobites in the world. Trilobites, hard-shelled, invertebrate marine creatures, roamed the ocean floor 500 million years ago. Trilobite fossils of over 8 species can be found relatively easily due to their near-perfect preservation in the easily split limestone shale.
At U-DIG Fossils in Delta, Utah, owners of this prehistoric cemetery provide fossil hunters the opportunity to find the perfect specimen. The U-DIG staff exposes fresh rock with an excavator on a regular basis. Tools are provided and the average visitor finds ten to twenty trilobites in a four-hour period."
