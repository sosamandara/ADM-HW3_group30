Robert Frost Farm	['eccentric homes', 'homes']	299	599	"From 1900 to 1911, New Hampshire’s most famous poet lived on this quiet Derry farm with his family.  
Frost’s most popular poems, found in his collections North of Boston and A Boy’s Will, were written here. Wander to the back of the property and you’ll find the subject of Frost’s Mending Wall, which introduced the now-familiar phrase “good fences make good neighbors” to the English lexicon.
The Robert Frost Farm is included in the National Register of Historic Places for its historical value and peaceful walking trails, but intrepid explorers know that the New England farmhouse is a little unusual. Frost’s first son died on the farm at age four, and depending on your tour guide, you may learn about the legends of the moving doll and the haunted upstairs room. In a place so old and so full of stories and imagination, it’s easy to feel that spirits have settled in the farmhouse and woods.  Are they ghosts of the Frost family or simply whispered poems that settle in your mind?"	Former abode of notable poet, complete with literary references and stories of ghosts.
