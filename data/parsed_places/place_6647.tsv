Hubertusbad	['swimming pools', 'pools', 'abandoned', 'architecture']	117	854	"This abandoned swimming pool crumbles within Berlin. It stands like a skeleton of its former luxury, its grandeur largely forgotten.
With two swimming pools, a sundeck, saunas, bathtubs, and even a small gym hall, Hubertusbad was considered Berlin’s most modern public bath house when it first opened in 1928. The architectural marvel, which is the work of Rudolf Gleve and Otto Weis, remained a hub for relaxation for decades.
Despite several interruptions, including World War II, the pool was in use until 1991. It was then sadly forced to close due to a number of defects too expensive to fix on the spot.
For many years, activists campaigned for the building to be revitalized. The cubist architecture, with expressionists elements and its cathedral feel, make you wish you could come here for a swim. But as long as that’s not possible, try to come for a guided tour instead. The building’s flair is well preserved, despite its overall decrepit state."
