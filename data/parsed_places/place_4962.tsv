Vinárna Čertovka	['urban planning', 'cities']	542	641	"Vinárna Čertovka is touted as the narrowest street in Prague. The 19.6-inch-wide path is really more of a staircase than a proper street, but that hasn’t stopped people from celebrating its svelte girth.
Only one person at a time can squeeze through the thin passageway, which cuts between two houses in one of the city’s most historic neighborhoods. There’s absolutely no room for two pedestrians approaching from opposite ends to pass one another, which led to quite a few tight situations.
To remedy this, someone installed a traffic light on either end of the street. With the push of a button, a walker can alert anyone waiting at the other end that they’re planning to pass through. However, be warned that busy tourists don’t always adhere to the light, so there’s a good chance you’ll wind up wedged within a traffic jam anyway.
For those who are a bit claustrophobic, the tiny street is easily avoidable. It’s merely a little urban planning quirk, and is thankfully not the main way to get to the restaurant tucked away at the end."	This walkway is so narrow it needs its own light to stop pedestrian traffic jams.
