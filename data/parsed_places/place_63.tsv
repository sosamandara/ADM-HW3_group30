Get Stuffed	['hunting and taxidermy', 'purveyors of curiosities', 'taxidermy']	221	460	"Although this local shop is only open by appointment it offers its onlooker one of the most intriguing window-shopping experiences in the Capital. Bears, tortoises and penguins sit alongside Islington’s main road, only a few minutes walk from East London’s cosmopolitan shopping hot-spot.
Drive by at night on the 73 or 476 buses to stare in bemusement at the array of stuffed animal carcasses which stare back at you with a liveliness beyond the scope of their rigor-mortis."	Taxidermied animals galore, by appointment only.
