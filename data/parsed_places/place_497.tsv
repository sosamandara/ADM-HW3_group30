Only 20 miles from Seattle, the small eco resort is home to six unique treehouses located near plenty of hiking and winter activities. The first treehouse built on the property, the Temple of the Blue Moon, was designed using lines from the Parthenon.
Situated on a lush chunk of land, Treehouse Point feels like a world away from the city. Set in a quintessential Pacific Northwest forest scene, large moss-covered spruce and cedar trees dominate the landscape as the rushing river below provides the soundtrack.
The retreat was opened in 2006 by Pete Nelson and his family, whose construction company has built tree houses around the world. The hosts are friendly and informative and offer tours of the structures by appointment. And, if youâ€™re inspired by the trip, Nelson offers workshops on building treehouses."	A whimsical village of unique treehouses resides in a Washington forest.
