Brooklyn Superhero Supply Store	['purveyors of curiosities', 'shops']	722	2822	"The Brooklyn Superhero Supply Store is exactly what it sounds like… or is it?
The store stocks all manner of eccentric equipment and merchandise for a crime-fighting customer base. From canned cyclones to Mylar force fields and, of course, capes and spandex, this store has everything a hero needs. Villains may also find this fast becoming their favorite one-stop shopping location, as the store also stocks tools that cater to a less savory crowd, including mind-readers, particle guns and bottled black holes.
The shop is more than meets the eye, however, as behind a false bookcase there is a secret lair that plays host to an afterschool student writing center co-founded by best-selling writer Dave Eggers.
All profits from the store, which is run by volunteers, benefit the students at the writing center. Some of the published works of the students are available in the store’s “manuals” section.
This store joins two others: The Pirate Supply in San Francisco and Hoxton Monster Supply in London, both businesses provide a fertile space to encourage kids to expand their writing skills. There are several other organizations under the banner of 826 in various cities across the United States that support future scribes."	The one-stop shop for all of your superhero (or evil arch-nemesis) needs.
