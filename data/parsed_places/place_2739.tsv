Cherry Springs State Park		271	1513	"Inside the Susquehannock State Forest is a dark spot.  An area with no artificial light pollution, it is a haven for east coast astronomers.
Cleaved off from the Susquehannock in 1922, the 48-acre park grew back from its near-obliteration due to clear-cutting.  In 2000, it was named a Dark Sky Park by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, and in 2007 was the second place added to the International Dark Sky Association’s register of “International Dark Sky Parks.”  Since acquiring the nearby Cherry Springs Airport in 2006, the area is so dark at night that, under ideal conditions, the Milky Way casts a visible shadow."	"""Dark Sky Park"" is heaven on Earth for astronomers, one of the rare U.S. locations with no artificial light pollution."
