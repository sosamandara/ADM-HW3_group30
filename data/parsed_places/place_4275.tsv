Minerve, France	['rock formations', 'medieval', 'geology']	83	567	"Sitting atop of a rocky outcrop nestled between two canyons covered in Mediterranean garrigue, Minerve is an imposing Cathar medieval city, listed among the most beautiful villages of France.
Built by the Viscounts of Minerve, the village is surrounded by a network of cliffs, natural bridges, vineyards, olive and chestnut trees.
Take a walk on the rampart, carved into the cliffside, which leads to the Saint-Rustique well, then climb the steps to the village to visit Saint-Etienne church dating from the 11th century. See the Dove stele dedicated to the memory of the Cathar martyrs, at the foot of the Candela, the ruins of the Château Vicomtal, where you can contemplate the two canyons.
Located between the Cévennes and Montagne Noire areas, Minerve is a surprising small mineral village and an exceptional historical site, one of the most surprising of the Hérault department.
This unique site is born from a tumultuous geological history and from the action of water over limestone over eons, which carved the rock into narrow canyons. Le Brian and la Cesse, the two intermittent rivers surrounding Minerve, created this natural rock fortress. What’s more, each summer, when the rivers cease to flow, natural rock arches and tunnels are accessible.
Minerve is also reputed for its great wines. The first vineyards were implanted by the Romans, and for centuries the Minervois area has produced strong fruity and mellow wines."	A well-preserved medieval village nested on a rocky outcrop and surrounded by a network of cliffs, natural bridges and canyons.
