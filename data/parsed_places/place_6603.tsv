Meadow Hot Springs	['hot springs', 'water']	133	494	"In the deserts of central Utah lies a trio of hot springs, an oasis of sorts for weary travelers.
Formed by volcanic activity thousands of years ago, the springs are encircled in white rock, sculpted to form a set of twisted pools. The water is vibrant blue, unpolluted, and pure. They can reach a depth of up to 25-feet, making them a fun stop for amateur scuba divers. Some even claim that there are underwater tunnels between two of the pools."	This set of three large, volcanic hot springs is a favorite haunt for intrepid divers.
