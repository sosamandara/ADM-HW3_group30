Mud Island River Park	['small worlds and model towns', 'miniatures']	846	1304	"The Mississippi is the fourth longest river in the world, but in Memphis, Tennessee you can see it all in one short afternoon.
The River Walk is a five-block-long replica of the lower Mississippi River, from Cairo, Illinois, to New Orleans, Lousiana. Each 30-inch stride is equivalent to one mile on the actual river. Along your journey, you’ll revisit historical events and learn about geographical transformations.
The “1,000-mile-journey” concludes at the Gulf of Mexico, a one-acre enclosure that holds 1.3 million gallons of water. There, visitors can enjoy a leisurely pedal boat ride around the Gulf area with the Memphis skyline in the background."	Walk the whole Mississippi River!
