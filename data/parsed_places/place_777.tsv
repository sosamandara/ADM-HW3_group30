St. Marys Submarine Museum	['submarines', 'world war ii', 'collections', 'military', 'museums']	151	616	"The St. Marys Submarine Museum gives visitors a real feel for life aboard a submarine. The functioning periscope lets visitors play lookout and imagine themselves as a captain of a real submarine, and who doesn’t want to do that? 
The museum’s 5,000 square feet of exhibition and displays feature real and working shipboard equipment. A ship’s contol panel, ballast control panel, periscope, and working sonar panels give exciting visuals of the interior of a submarine. There is also an area for informative submarine movies, a gift shop, and a display dedicated to the eight submariners who received the Medal of Honor.
The 20,000 insightful artifacts displayed throughout the place include torpedo models, deep-sea diving suits, submarine uniforms, and scaled replicas of submarines. A dive suit from World War II and submarine uniform exhibits give an idea of necessary submarine attire. Although it is only the fifth largest submarine museum, it holds 99% of WWII Patrol Reports. The command history files live at St. Marys Submarine Museum, along with other documents, photographs and the spirit of submarine history."	Interactive modern and vintage submarine equipment, World War II relics, and submarine attire.
