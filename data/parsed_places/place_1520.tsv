The Bunny Museum	"['bunnies', 'obscura day locations', 'world record', ""world's largest"", 'collections', 'museums and collections', 'animals', 'museums']"	184	948	"If you’re in Pasadena and you want to see an Andy Warhol painting, you go to the Norton Simon Museum. If you want to see Gainsborough’s “The Blue Boy,” you visit the Huntington Library. But if you want to see the world’s largest collection of bunny memorabilia, you definitely want to visit the Bunny Museum.
For Candace Frazee and Steve Lubanski, their love for bunnies is a constant reminder of their love for one another. So what innocently began as an occasional bunny-related gift exchange between two partners, eventually led to a collection of more than 35,000 bunny items.
From floppy ears to cottontails, Candace and Steve have been celebrating their love for each other by exchanging bunny gifts every day since 1993. The private collection was originally on display in their home, which doubled as the museum, but moved to a mid-century building in Altadena in 2017. 
To get a sense of how far they have lapped their nearest competitor, the Guinness Book of World Records certified them as the biggest bunny repository back in 1999 when they had 8,437 pieces — less than a third of what they have now. The Bunny Museum also includes an extensive bunny-related puzzle collection, nine large-scale Rose Parade floats, and live, litter-box trained cotton-tailed pets who roam about the museum. Though a number of the pet bunnies have passed away over the years, several have been preserved and are immortalized in a glass display cabinet. More are in the process of preservation."	"""The Hoppiest Place in the World"" holds the world’s largest collection of bunny memorabilia and is a singular testament of a couple's devotion to all things Leporidae."
