Dark Matter Oddities & Artisan Collective	['victorian', 'taxidermy', 'shops', 'collections']	171	971	"Dark Matter Oddities & Artisan Collective located in the French Quarter is an offbeat home to both the beautiful and macabre. The shop contains a curated combination of strange antiques, locally hand-crafted artwork, and small-batch artisan products.
A small group of artists produces an array of taxidermy, wet specimens, articulated skeletons, as well as more “traditional” art forms such as paintings and handmade jewelry.
The locally owned spooky boutique also boasts various antiques, such as Victorian ephemera, memento mori, post mortem photography, medical devices, religious objects, ethnographic artifacts, and fossils. The inventory is always changing inside this shop and all taxidermied items were produced ethically."	This macabre shop, filled with art, oddities, and taxidermy is hidden in the heart of the French Quarter.
