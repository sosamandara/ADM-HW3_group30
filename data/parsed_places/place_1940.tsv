Camp 18 Restaurant	['logging', 'cabins', 'restaurants', 'food', 'museums and collections', 'history']	380	511	"The stretch of U.S. Highway 26 between Portland and Cannon Beach is one of the most traveled thruways in Oregon, connecting the state’s largest city with one of its most picturesque beaches. If you find yourself making the drive, look out for the sprawling log cabin on the side of the road advertised by a rickety old water tower with the words “Camp 18 Restaurant.”
This logging-themed diner and museum is a unique and beloved roadside stop. The rustic log cabin is made almost entirely out of wood, so much so that even the tables are made out of tree stumps. And by “wood” think: gigantic towering logs. There’s a huge 85-foot, 25-ton ridgepole in the main room—the largest in the U.S.—and the entrance doors are over 4 inches thick. The portions of comfort food served up are “logger-sized” too; the famous cinnamon roll weighs about 3 pounds. 
Walking through the doors you’re welcomed by several hand-carved wooden statues, featuring dancing wooden bears, a man with an axe, and, of course, the legendary Sasquatch in all his hairy glory. Outside the restaurant’s doors lies a yard of preserved albeit rusted logging equipment, offering a glance into the history of one of Oregon’s defining industries. 
Once you’ve finished your meal, behind the restaurant is a beautiful clear mountain stream with native crayfish and agates to discover."	A logging-themed roadside restaurant surrounded by museum-quality machinery and artifacts from the industry's heyday.
