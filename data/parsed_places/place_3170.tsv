Trevi Waterfall	['waterfalls', 'roman', 'natural wonders', 'water', 'nature']	87	501	"The Aniene river is one of the major tributaries of the Tiber and within the Regional Park of the Simbruini Mountains. Its crystal clear waters flow throughout the scenic locations and culminate at the beautiful Trevi Waterfall.
The falls cascade into a pond surrounded by lush vegetation and archaeological remains. This area was also known as Comunacque, and the waters may have been diverted to supply water to the imperial city of Rome via the aqueduct known as the “Anio Novus” around the 1st century.
The Aniene river, along with its tributaries and springs, were key to Rome’s growth and development. The Simbruini Mountains, with their karstic geology and heavy rainfall, provide an infinite source of clear and cold spring water.
The opus quadratum blocks surrounding the site can be attributed to hydraulic projects and a villa dating back to the age of Emperor Claudius. There are also several medieval remains that can be attributed to one of Trevi’s seven castles and the monastery of San Salvatore."	A magnificent waterfall is also home to the remains of a Roman hydraulic engineering system.
