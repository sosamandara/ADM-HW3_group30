Pont del Diable	['water', 'architectural oddities', 'architecture']	167	480	"When the Roman Empire slowly contracted, it left its legacy across Europe in the form of stunning architecture. Stretching narrowly on the outskirts of Tarragona, the Pont del Diable, also known as the Pont de les Ferreres, is a lasting mark from this innovative empire that nearly conquered the world.
Built in the 1st century BCE, the Pont del Diable was constructed as a massive aqueduct that brought water to the city of Tarragona from 15 miles away. Sturdily constructed with two layers of arches, 711 feet still remain to forge a link to antiquity in Catalonia. Besides a link to the Roman Empire, the aqueduct was actually used into the 18th century to bring water to Tarragona, showing the perfection of Roman architecture.
Nearly above the tree-line, the aqueduct rises 90 feet over the ground, and dark green trees around its sides nestle the monument deep in the Spanish countryside. Those who want to experience the aqueduct first hand and get an amazing view can take a tour on the bridge-like structure and walk along its perilous ledge. The monument has been dedicated a UNESCO World Heritage Monument."	Stunning Roman aqueduct used for 1900 years and still standing.
