Hopewell Rocks	['geological oddities', 'natural wonders', 'water', 'geology', 'nature']	547	440	"Also known as the Flowerpot Rocks due to their unique tapered shape, the Hopewell Rocks are one of the most unique tidal formations in North America.
Caused by the ever moving tide off the Canadian coast, these rocks have spindly bases and arches that continue to be gnawed away at by the sea. The tidal movement is drastic enough, during the two low tides and two high tides every day, that if one times a visit right, during a low tide, one can walk the beach at the base of the stones.
But you’ll have to be quick…like, say, a couple of hours. Tides are a-changing. It’s what they do. Within 6 hours of the low, you’ll be experiencing a high…tide. And for that, you’ll need to be either on shore, or in a kayak! Many can be see during the summer, with paddlers moving in and around these gorgeous columns.
As part of the Bay Of Fundy, home to the world’s highest tides, you are looking at a whopping 46-50 feet depth of change, twice daily. (And yes, these in and outs happen over the wee hours: The tidal business operates 24/7!) …low tide or high tide, under a full moon…feel the pull…and don’t forget the camera.
Fyi, Many of the standing rocks also have sparse vegetation on their plateaus which has earned them their flowery nickname.  Look, don’t touch. It beautiful and fragile."
