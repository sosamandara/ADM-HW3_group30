The Little Falls	['dams', 'waterfalls', 'water']	266	482	"In between a highway on-ramp and the Sheraton Suites is a beautiful section of the Cuyahoga River. There, a waterfall known as “The Little Falls” and the surrounding gorge are often overlooked by residents and visitors.
The Little Falls and Big Falls, one mile south in Gorge Metro park, are important to the health of the Cuyahoga River. Like many rivers in industrial areas, dams were installed in the early 1900s to control flooding and to power factories and mills. As a result, the waterfalls disappeared beneath human-made barriers.
In 2013, two dams with 35 feet of concrete were removed from this section of river. Other dams in cities downstream were demolished, creating natural whitewater rapids and revealing the Little Falls.
Today, this section of river has attracted professional whitewater kayakers who test their skills against the might of the Cuyahoga. An annual kayak race features the Class III waterfall “Little Falls,” Class II rapids, and a Class V rapid.
Wildlife has returned to the same river that caught fire 50 years earlier including muskrat, mink, otter, and numerous native fish species."	For decades, this waterfall remained hidden because of an artificial dam.
