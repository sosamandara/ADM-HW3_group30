Labyrinth at Land’s End	['labyrinths', 'mazes', 'art outside']	1349	2962	"Burnt once, destroyed twice, and rebuilt at the edge of the continent, the labyrinth at Land’s End may be Land’s End’s most beautiful secret.
San Francisco artist Eduardo Aguilera was first inspired by learning about other historic labyrinths, and then moved to create his own after spending time along the rocky shoreline of Land’s End, lighting candles and creating a small shrine to, in the artist’s own words, “peace, love, and enlightenment.”
Aguilera’s creation is constructed simply of a stone outline following the classic seven-circuit Chartres labyrinth. At first, he hoped to keep it anonymous but his work was quickly discovered by other hikers and explorers.
The labyrinth has been destroyed on two occasions by persons unknown, but Aguilera rebuilt it each time. In 2004 the artist lit the labyrinth with candles for the Winter Solstice, and in 2005 he lit it ablaze for the Vernal Equinox. One of the last incidents happened in 2015 when the Labyrinth was destroyed yet again. However, a month later the author with a team of volunteers restored the design.
On a dramatic outcropping with sweeping views of the Golden Gate Bridge, the Marin Headlands and out to sea, the labyrinth’s location is naturally both peaceful and majestic. The labyrinth is not officially endorsed by the Land’s End National Park area, and the trails leading to the promontory are unmaintained. Visitors be warned: the cliffside location can be windy and slippery.
Aguilera has constructed at least two other labyrinths in the Marin Headlands and San Bruno Mountains."	A winding path built in secret on the edge of the continent.
