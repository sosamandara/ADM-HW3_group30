Cool Patch Pumpkins Corn Maze	['corn', 'mazes', 'shops']	167	516	"There are some elaborate corn mazes out there, but the Cooley Brothers took the Halloween favorite to a whole other level.
Cool Patch Pumpkins has been growing and selling pumpkins since 1999; however, it hasn’t always been easy. Poor sales in the initial years forced the owners, Matt and Mark Cooley, to find new ways to attract more customers. In 2003, they created a 15-acre corn maze that lured hundreds of families. As the pumpkins started to sell, the brothers became ambitious with their main attraction.
The maze grew in size each year until 2007 when the labyrinth was awarded the Guinness Book of World Records “world’s largest temporary corn maze” prize. But it didn’t stop there: On its 10th anniversary in Fall 2012, the maze stretched a total of 53 acres, more than 13 acres larger than the 2007 record layout.
The Cooley brothers continue to modify and expand the maze annually. They create a new design each year, starting with a detailed blueprint and later hand-cutting each and every turn of the massive design."	This corn maze so big you may want to pack a lunch, and possibly a flaregun.
