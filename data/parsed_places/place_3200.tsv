Made by Oregonian sculptor Keith Jellum, the hand-forged bronze fish measures 11 feet in length. It was placed in a very fitting location on a seafood restaurant on Salmon Street.
The absurdity of an oversized metal salmon crashing through the brickwork of a popular restaurant is not lost on those who notice it, though its location on the 3rd floor of the building means that it is often overlooked by passersby."
