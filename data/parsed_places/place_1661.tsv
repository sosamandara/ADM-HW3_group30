Heald Square Monument's Statue of Liberty	['statue of liberty', 'plaques', 'sculptures', 'statues']	280	702	"The Heald Square Monument is a Chicago landmark, an 11-foot tall bronze sculpture by Larado Taft showing General George Washington standing between the two principal financiers of the American Revolution, Robert Morris and Haym Salomon.
What makes this beautiful sculpture particularly interesting is the little-known bronze plaque on the back side of the granite base, showing a seated Statue of Liberty. In this depiction, Lady Liberty is “stretching out her arms to welcome all persons of whatever race and belief.”"	The iconic Chicago sculpture hides a beautiful and easily overlooked plaque on the backside.
