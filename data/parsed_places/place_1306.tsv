El Vilsito	['taco', 'pork', 'street food', 'Unique Restaurants & Bars']	109	470	"If you were to drive by El Vilsito during the day, you’d find mechanics working on cars. Come 8:00 p.m., however, and this humble garage becomes home to several spinning spits of some of the finest marinated meat in Mexico City.
Servers wielding giant knives slice off chunks of the succulent pork and layer it onto corn tortillas, along with a flick of pineapple and a sprinkling of onions and cilantro to make stunningly sweet and savory al pastor tacos. Even though the mechanics are long gone, hints of the space’s body shop alter ego remain: a sign displaying a giant red car hovers overhead and services are emblazoned across the red-and-black exterior, offering to improve your ride’s lubricación, suspensión, or transmisión. 
There are several tables and chairs inside part of the garage next to the open kitchen, but it’ll be easiest to grab a standing table outside. There are other options for your taco filling, including steak and rib, but the real star here is the pastor. It’s dangerously easy to order at least four.
If you find yourself in need of some lubricación, wash it all down with a cold beer or horchata."	By night, this auto repair shop turns into a taquería serving up some of the city's finest al pastor tacos.	['/places/scop-center', '/places/radio-museum', '/places/panteon-frances-de-la-piedad']	Av.
