The style of buildings ranges from Arts & Crafts to Classical to Baroque, painted in pastel hues, surrounding a reflecting pond and central lawn. Williams-Ellis incorporated architectural ruins and bits of salvaged buildings into his designs, including many disparate styles. Among other things Williams-Ellis called the village his “home for fallen buildings” and the extensive grounds are dotted with follies, sculptures, and ornamental ponds all part of his “light opera” approach to architecture.
Portmeirion Village was made world famous when it was used as the setting for the wonderful 1960s British TV cult classic “The Prisoner,” and hosts a Prisoner weekend every year. Visitors can visit for a day trip or stay in various village buildings overnight. For fans of the TV series, opening the curtains in the morning onto the village square is an unforgettable experience.
In 2001 extensive rebuilding of the mansion Castell Deudraeth on the property were completed and opened as a hotel and restaurant."
