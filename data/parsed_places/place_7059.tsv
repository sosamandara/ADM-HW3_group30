House of Yes	['wondrous performances', 'purveyors of curiosities']	496	1577	"This is the third incarnation of the House of Yes—the first one was in a Bed-Stuy basement and was mostly a spot for wild underground parties. When a massive fire demolished that space in the mid-2000s, Anya and Kae decided to create a highly professional aerialist training facility and performance venue in the heart of East Williamsburg. In 2013 the lost the lease on the second space, and began a search for an even grander location. After six months of searching, they signed a lease on their current location in Bushwick and they officially opened on New Years 2016. The new location is larger and features a full service restaurant and bar. 
They continue to put on high-energy, high-caliber, innovative circus and cabaret performances. They make all their costumes in the Make Fun Labs, build their own sets, and collaborate with Brooklyn bands for live musical accompaniment. Performances showcase aerialists, trapezists, fire-dancers, contortionists, burlesque acts, singers, musicians, and more. House of Yes is also a great after-hours party spot, with DJs spinning far into the wee hours most weekend nights.
Many of the House of Yes denizens also make up the loose conglomeration of female acrobats Lady Circus, performing at underground parties and cabarets across the country. The Lady Circus performers were even featured as a costume-design challenge on Project Runway in 2011.
