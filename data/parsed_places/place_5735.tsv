The Secret Chamber House of Oddities and Artwork	['oddities', 'shops', 'collections']	165	1048	"Inside this eclectic oddity shop, visitors will find two-headed animals, skeletons, and various side showpieces.
This unique shop is located on one of the most interesting streets in Ohio that is littered with oddity stores, Halloween shops open all year, comic and toy stores.
The Secret Chamber was the brainchild of horror enthusiasts and collector Cherish Harrell Brooks. This is much more than a store, its truly an experience and journey through all things weird and bizarre. Haunted items, animals in jars, and serial killer memorabilia are just a few of the relics that grace the shelves and walls of this shop."	Inside this wonderland of weird, visitors are treated to a collection ranging from skeletons to haunted artifacts.
