Lizzie Borden Bed and Breakfast and Museum	['places to stay', 'eccentric homes', 'homes']	683	1766	"The story of Lizzie Borden is a sad and hair-raising tale that lives on through her home that is now a bed and breakfast and museum in Fall River, Massachusetts.
On August 4, 1892, Andrew Borden and his wife Abby Borden were found brutally murdered in their home with their skulls caved in by the vicious blows of a hatchet. Famously, their youngest daughter, Lizzie, became the main suspect in the murder case, as she was the only one around and the first to find them. Furthermore, Lizzie was believed to have fiscal and emotional incentives to kill her father and stepmother. During the trial, Lizzie was acquitted of her alleged crimes.
The Borden house on 92 Second street is now a bed an breakfast and museum that is open to the public year round. Inside the entire crime scene has been recreated and memorabilia from that dismal night can be bought at the gift store in the back. Lizzie’s room, as well as that of her father and stepmother’s, are available to stay in if you feel brave enough to do so. But just a warning: the house is known for its supposed paranormal activities."	Enjoy an overnight at an old haunted B&B site of the Borden family murders.
