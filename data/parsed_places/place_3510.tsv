The Weeping Glass	['oddities', 'stores', 'taxidermy', 'shops']	282	1863	"Is there a void in your tiny black heart because you don’t have a raccoon baculum (penis bone) in your strange collection of things? The Weeping Glass, a morbidly macabre oddities shop, can help you with that.
This dark little oddities store in the Allentown neighborhood is stuffed with a pleasantly depressing blend of the magically unusual. The Weeping Glass opened in the fall of 2017 with a focus on odd art, unusual gifts, natural history, antiques, and all things morose. It’s part curiosity shop, part event space.
The macabre space is brimming with interesting art and objects from all over the world. You’ll find the usual oddities shop stock here, like animal bits and bones, strange things stuffed inside glass, and taxidermy critters.
In addition to browsing its assortment of morbid items, you can also partake in a Tarot reading or taxidermy class. The store hosts a Midnight Death Parlor, where each month it welcomes a different performance artist to tell a candlelit tale of tragedy and murder. Themed cocktails and dark delicacies are curated and served, and exclusive ephemera is created for each event.
The Weeping Glass folks are up to all kinds of strange and dark things these days. Their sister project, Morose & Macabre, hosts The Atrocity Exhibition at Rex Theater, an annual procession of  “the beautiful and grotesque” featuring a wicked cabaret of unusual artists, entertainers, and vendors. Founded in 2009, The Atrocity Exhibition is Pittsburgh’s largest and fastest-growing annual underground event."	A beautiful oddities shop crammed with strange and morbid curiosities.
