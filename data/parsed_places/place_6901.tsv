Umbrella Alley	['umbrellas', 'alleyways', 'outsider art', 'art']	105	698	Hidden in the middle of Baytownâ€™s Downtown Arts District is an art installation of unique proportions. Umbrella Alley derived from an initiative to beautify the historic Texas Avenue area in Baytown. Down this short alley, over 120 multicolored umbrellas float overhead, casting dancing shadows on the ground and alley walls. Umbrellas of every color create a wonderful, whimsical feel when venturing down the alley. The umbrella installation was created by the Baytown Tourism Team and the mural art was done by the Lee College Art Department. It displays the unique ecology of the Baytown area.	Tucked away down this Baytown alley exists a one-of-a-kind art exhibit of technicolor umbrellas.
