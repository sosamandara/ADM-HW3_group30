Hale's Palladium	['Unique Restaurants & Bars']	317	878	"In addition to brewing a variety of robust beers, Seattle’s Hale’s Ales Brewery features a warehouse that occasionally metamorphoses into a theater.
When not storing the various seasonal, limited edition, or stand-by beers, their expansive warehouse is transformed into a 250-seat performance venue called Hale’s Palladium. This show space, with its high ceilings and spacious layout, is often home to limited-run circus performances and music festivals which regularly attract massive crowds to the brewhouse. The Palladium also features a colorful backdrop that echoes the bright lights and lush curtains of Vaudeville theaters.
Anyone in the Seattle area looking for good times and great brews can check the Hale’s Ales website to check what’s playing the Palladium and see what seasonal beers they have to offer."
