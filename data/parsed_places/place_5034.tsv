The Paris Market	['purveyors of curiosities', 'shops']	750	2035	"Started by a speech pathologist and emergency physician, the Paris Market reflects the pair’s clear love of travel. On finding the famous Parisian flea market known as “Marche aux Puces,” the couple decided to travel the world in search of other magical marketplaces, finding the chaotic, intoxicating bazaars of Cairo, Alexandria, and Rajasthan along their way.
Always finding new inspiration in their annual travels, the owners of the Paris Market claim to take their cues from “Milan, Rome, and Florence, the wacky fun of the English countryside, London wharfs, and famous Portobello Road, and the flea market high style of Hungary, Holland, and Belgium.”
Filled with everything from taxidermy to pillows with coral prints, the Paris Market contains something for both the curio hunter as well as for the simply curious shopper."	This quirky curiosity shop takes its cues from the world's bazaars.
