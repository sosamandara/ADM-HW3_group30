Enchanted Hart Haus	['outsider architecture', 'outsider art', 'houses']	56	413	"A private residence in Denver’s East Colfax neighborhood has been transformed into what Steve Hartbauer calls the “Enchanted Hart Haus.” Hartbauer has been working on his house for 10 years and estimates another 10 years until it is complete. The colors and themes of the mosaic tiles that wrap around the house represent the four elements: fire, earth, air, and water. His folk art includes mosaic art, glass bottle sculptures, and metal sculptures.
Hartbauer believes that art should be shared with everyone, regardless of economic means. As he said in an interview, “not everybody has access to galleries and museums, and I want to share my art with anybody that’s either walking by or riding their bikes, driving by.”
He loves when it’s discovered outside of galleries and museums. It should be in our daily lives whether it’s music, film, visual art, dance, poetry, literature, or a combination of them. It is a manifestation of the human spirit; critical to our survival. Future plans for the house include adding a throne in the back and to start working on transforming the inside of the garage."	A home covered with elaborate mosaic and other pieces of art.
