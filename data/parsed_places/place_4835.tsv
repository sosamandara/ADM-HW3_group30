Sunland Park Dinosaur Tracks	['dinosaurs', 'prehistoric', 'deserts', 'animals']	55	460	"In 2003, dinosaur tracks were discovered by geologist Eric Kappus at Cerro de Cristo Rey. These 97 million-year-old footprints speckle the landscape and are a wondrous glimpse of the prehistoric past.

While exploring the area, you’ll come across tracks made by creatures of the Cretaceous Period. You can see fossil beds and enormous trackways where it looks like a whole herd of dinosaurs once passed through.
