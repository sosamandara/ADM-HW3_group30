Fairy Pools	['cryptozoology', 'natural wonders', 'nature']	822	4144	"Scottish culture is chock full of naturalistic Celtic myths and legends that speak of magical beings living under hills, and waters filled with beasts large and small. The Fairy Pools near Carbost, Scotland embody that sense of magic in their unbelievably blue waters.
Accessible only by a foot hike through the Glen Brittle forest, the series of small waterfalls that make up the so-called Fairy Pools are some of the most pristine swimming holes in the world. On a sunny day, the turquoise waters of the natural pools are so clear, one can readily see each moss-covered stone at the bottom.
Located at the foot of the Cuillin Mountains, the crystal-clear water flows between pools with waterfalls of various shapes and sizes. On wet, cloudy days after a good rain, torrents of water rush and whirl in thunderous cascades.
There does not seem to be a legend attributed to the fairy pools, but rather the pools look as though they were pulled from the imagination of J.R.R. Tolkien. The waters of the Fairy Pools might be bone-chillingly cold, but their near supernatural atmosphere has made them one of Scotland’s most enduring natural wonders."	These fantastically named natural pools look like something out of a Scottish myth.
