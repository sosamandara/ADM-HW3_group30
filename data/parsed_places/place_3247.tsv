Crow Manor	['places to stay']	109	506	"Founded by David Kujawa, the Crow Manor is a collective made up of artists, musicians, and activists. With a community garden and a functioning, work-working shop, the Crow Manor holds workshops with some frequency. The current collective is working on getting a metal forge and are producing their own honey with bee boxes.
The Crow Manor collective also works to put on shows throughout the year. The most famous organized event to date was the Crownival, a large party held at a large Victorian mansion on Trumbull Street."	Collective made up of artists, musicians, and activists.
