The Troll Museum	['collections']	36	610	"In a sixth floor walk-up in New York City’s Lower East Side, a woman in elf ears named Reverend Jen, along with her pet chihuahua, Reverend Jen Jr., give a guided tour of a unique collection of vintage trolls and troll memorabilia.
Admission is free, however, there is a piggy bank with a sign on it that reads, “Suggested donation: $3,000.” Be sure to call (212-560-7235) the museum’s self-proclaimed “trollologist” beforehand; visits are by appointment only.
Update: Reverend Jen’s Troll Museum and Reverend Jen herself were evicted from this location in 2016. Besides a pop-up exhibit at Chinatown Soup in August 2016, the collection remains in storage until a new location is announced."	Reverend Jen's unique museum/living room showcases her troll collection.
