The Island, Newquay	['places to stay', 'eccentric homes', 'shops', 'islands', 'homes']	233	445	"“The Island” of Newquay, Cornwall is joined to the mainland by a suspension bridge. Actually a 70-foot high rocky outcropping, it appears to be an island when the tide is in, but one can walk right up to it when the tide is out. The bridge was built in 1900 and is a suspension footbridge with a gentle bounce as you walk across. Though it wasn’t designed with those suffering from acrophobia in mind, it is regularly inspected and very safe.
There’s only one house on the tiny island, which can be rented as up-market self-catering accommodation. Surrounded by a beautiful garden which itself is surrounded either by the sands of Towan Beach or by the sea - depending on the time of day - the island is about 70 feet high and accessible only on foot via the suspension bridge.
In a strange claim to fame, the house was once the residence of Sir Oliver Joseph Lodge, the inventor of the spark plug, who is rumored to have entertained on The Island his friend Sir Arthur Conan-Doyle, with whom he shared an interest in spiritualism."	Sometimes an island, sometimes a rocky outcropping connected to the world by a tiny suspension bridge.
