Grand Midway Hotel	['hotels']	56	428	This hotel has a lot of history hidden and creepy charm within the haunted 33 room structure. Filmmaker Blair Murphy relocated from Los Angeles to save it from being torn down, and has since transformed into a museum of sorts containing all kinds of supernatural and interesting items. Each room has its own intricately decorated theme, including the Vampire Suite, Frankenstein Suite, Shakespeare Suite, Beatnik Suite, Dragon Suite, Canopy Room, and Mermaid Room.  The first floor boasts a large antique ship bar that had possibly been a tribute to the famed Titanic as the Titanic actually purchased its coal from the town of Windber.  The ceiling in the next room over hangs the Guinness’ World’s largest Tarot Card.  The roof sports the Guinness’ World’s Largest Ouija Board.  Overnight guests are treated to an hour ghost tore and then released to explore the place in the middle of the night on their own.	An occult-y, historic hotel with the World's Largest Ouija board on the roof.
