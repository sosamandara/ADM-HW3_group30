Krýsuvíkurbjarg (Krýsuvík Cliffs)	['cliffs', 'rock formations', 'birds', 'rocks', 'geology', 'animals']	189	596	"Harsh winds and cold ocean spray don’t ruffle the feathers of the thousands of birds who come to summer on Krýsuvíkurbjarg.
Reaching the cliffs requires a bumpy drive or a long walk across the lava fields, dotted with bubbling geothermal pools steaming from the volcano below. The cliffs appear from suddenly, a dramatic drop from the grassy lawn straight down to the sea crashing against the rock face. The wind blows fiercely. These conditions might seem inhospitable, but that’s far from the case for the birds that migrate here in the summers.
Every year around 60,000 seabirds come to the cliffs to mate. Depending on the season, visitors can see guillemots and other auks, puffins, seagulls, European shags, sandpipers, and peewits. The birds tuck themselves into the tiniest crevices in the cliff face, making themselves at home despite the odds. What’s more, thanks to Iceland’s “midnight sun,” you can enjoy the view practically any time of day."	The summer tourists on these cliffs are thousands of seabirds.
