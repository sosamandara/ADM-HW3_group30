Brigit's Celtic Garden	['horticulture', 'cultures and civilizations', 'plants']	144	1443	"Themed on the Celtic seasonal festivals, Brigit’s Garden is widely regarded as one of the most spectacular gardens in Ireland, set within 11 acres of native woodland & wildflower meadows. A walk through the gardens is a journey through the cycle of the year, each garden representing one of the Celtic festivals: Samhain, Imbolc, Bealtaine and Lughnasa.
This seasonal cycle mirrors the cycle of life from conception to old age and death. These are wildlife gardens, designed to reflect the West of Ireland landscape and managed to encourage biodiversity. The Garden’s features include: a Celtic nature trail, Celtic writings and ogham trees, children’s discovery trail, living willow play area, an ancient Celtic ring fort (fairy fort), Neolithic roundhouse and Celtic calendar sundial – the largest in Ireland – and the Iron Age roundhouse and standing stone circle and Crannog."	The world of the ancient Celtic civilization explained through a bewitching 11 acre garden.
