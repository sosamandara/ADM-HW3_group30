Now they serve diners espresso, flat whites, and amazing breakfast. Walk down the stairs to take your seat at one of the full size, porcelain urinals and sip your coffee among the most elite, historical toilets in Fitzrovia.
Originally built in the 1890s, these public toilets were closed in the 1960s. They sat boarded up for over 50 years before being reimagined as an upscale coffee bar."
