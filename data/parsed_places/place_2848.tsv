'Adalanta Desert'	['kcymaerxthaere', 'roads', 'restaurants']	164	484	"Kcymaerxthaere is an art project created by Eames Demetrios. A series of plaques and other markers around the world honor events that have taken place in a parallel universe that, according to Demetrios, “co-exists to some degree with ours.” Most of these installations are bronze or stone plaques inscribed with stories but some are larger, even entire buildings. As of 2021, there are more than 140 sites spread across six continents and 30 countries. 
In Kcymaerxthaereal times, both iconic figures and musical roadways intersected at this Atlanta, Georgia site. And, today, downstairs in an elegant building complex (with some great restaurants), near the power panels, you’ll find the story of these probably less familiar events.  Specifically, you’ll see how the Tehachapi, the great road-building culture of Kcymaerxthaere built staggeringly elegant roadways that crossed the searing desert that spanned many gwomes, including Atalanta and Ironinh and parts of Stoan Mountin. Where they crossed was a natural stopping point for travelers. And thus, with hospitality rare and far between, it was inevitable that momentous meetings would take place where someone like Martha Pelaski could provide reasonably good food and comfort–from self-connection as with Iglesia Guitierrez to Nobunaga-Gaisen’s meeting with Alcibiades–and its near fatal consequences.
Take a moment to find this piece of the story next time you are in Atlanta (and then grab a nice treat at Little Star )."	Beside some power panels, a plaque celebrates the history of an alternate world.
