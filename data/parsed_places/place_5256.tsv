Everything Is Terrible	['oddities', 'stores', 'collections']	58	576	"In 2000, a group of friends from Ohio University created what would become a YouTube sensation, Everything is Terrible! Taking the internet by storm, the group collected the most outrageous and strangest clips from VHS tapes they discovered in thrift shops or unearthed at yard sales.
This newly opened storefront is adorned inside with roughly 500 of their 12,240 VHS copies of Jerry Maguire. This now permanent location allows visitors to dive into the vast world of video oddities."	This store is dedicated to unique found footage and the strangeness of pre-internet pop-culture.
