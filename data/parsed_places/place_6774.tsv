Roy and Walt were born in the house joining their two older brothers, Herbert and Raymond, and later their sister Ruth. The family would eventually sell the home and move to Missouri in 1906.  
The home was purchased by Dina Benadon and Brent Young in 2012. According to a 2013 New York Times article the couple, “…intend to operate the property as a private museum, called the Walt Disney Birthplace, offering tours and staging modest exhibitions.”"	A chance to follow in the footsteps of the word's most legendary animator.
