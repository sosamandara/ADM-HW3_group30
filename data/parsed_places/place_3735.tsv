Unit 11 in the Everglades	['plants']	95	550	This area is also known as the Hungryland Slough Natural Area.  This area was originally slated for one-acre rural residential homes, streets were created, and canals dug.  Due to its location, the developers were never able to work out adequate drainage to actually build on the sites and the lots were purchased by the county of Palm Beach. In 2007, restoration work was completed to return the area to its original wetland state.	A failed, un-built suburb that has been going feral for decades.
