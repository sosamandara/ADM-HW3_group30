Santa Fe Botanical Garden at Museum Hill	['botanical gardens']	213	538	"This is not your average botanical garden. There are no manicured lawns or giant beds of flowers here. This garden is dedicated to the plants that thrive in the high desert environment where water is scarce. The Botanical Garden at Museum Hill was designed by landscape architect W. Gary Smith, and features a mashup of native and non-native plants. 
Museum Hill also features several trails, including one designed for bikers. Others wander over the mountain top, alternating between thickets of flowering desert bushes and views of the surrounding landscape. Interspersed with the various plants are incredible sculptures created by local artists."	This high desert botanical garden is a unique display of Northern New Mexico's geology.
