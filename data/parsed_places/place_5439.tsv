Kalalau Trail	['rainforest', 'cliffs', 'hiking', 'nature']	216	408	"The Kalalau Trail winds more than 11 miles through Kauai’s Napali Coast. Dense, muddy rainforest, rocky inclines, unpredictable weather and narrow paths along sheer cliffs has earned it the reputation of one of the most dangerous trails in the world. This trek is not for the faint-hearted, however enduring the difficult trip is well worth the effort.
The trail weaves its way between dense rainforest valleys and steep, rocky cliffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean below. One particularly notorious stretch, Crawler’s Ledge, is no more than a foot-wide ledge of crumbly rock hundreds of feet above the rocky coast.
Hikers must cross three streams before arriving at Kalalau Beach. Due to frequent, unpredictable downpours, streams can quickly overflow and become impassable. It’s not uncommon for hikers to be stranded along the trail until flooded streams return to their normal levels. Hikers who are willing to make the effort are rewarded with beautiful views of one of the most dramatic coastlines in the world.
Update as of September: As the result of the March 2021 floods, a landslide occurred on Kuhio Highway at Mile Marker 1. Ever since, road work has temporarily blocked access to Haena. Please for schedule on the Hawaii Department of Transportation website."	This narrow coastline trail through the dense Kauai wilderness is among the most beautiful and dangerous in the world.
