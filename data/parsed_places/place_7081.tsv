The Sea Hagg	['mermaids', 'antiquities', 'disney', 'pirates', 'oddities', 'fishing', 'outsider art', 'collections', 'art']	194	793	"Ever wondered what a hybrid of an antique store and a curiosity shop would look like if it had been run by an artistic pirate? If so, the Sea Hagg may be your answer.
Opened in 1998, The Sea Hagg is perhaps best described as a three-way combination of maritime oddities museum, outsider artwork installation, and nautical antique shop. The residents of Cortez, Florida, still struggle to come up with any better definition.
Owner Jan Holman estimates her collection includes more than a million dollars worth of antique mermaids, pirates, sea hags, fishing floats, fish nets, oars, lanterns, coins, buoys, and shells. It’s not clear if that estimate also includes the 16-foot sawfish bill, the seashell-coated African fertility chair,  the “Grandmother Willow” from the Disney film Pocahontas, or the skull-adorned shrimp boat Deanna Belle that are connected to the store—every last one of which is for sale.
The Sea Hagg has also become a venue for events including book signings, fishing festivals and, naturally, a pirate treasure show."	An eclectic treasure trove of maritime marvels.
