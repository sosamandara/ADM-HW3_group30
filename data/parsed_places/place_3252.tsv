Your Rainbow Panorama	['architectural oddities', 'art', 'architecture']	298	655	"Ringing the ARoS Aarhus Art Museum in Denmark like a technicolor halo is artist Olafur Eliasson’s permanent work Your Rainbow Panorama, which allows guests to walk around and see the surrounding city through every color of the rainbow. 
From the orange-yellow ports to the purple houses next door, the city as viewed through the shaded glass walls of the circular walkway is transformed into a new form of monochrome every few feet. The light coming in through the glass paints visitors in an equally strong light making each person strolling through the 150-foot ring into a living crayon.  
Equally striking from the outside, Your Rainbow Panorama makes ARoS one of the easiest buildings in the city to find. From the ground people can watch as tiny figures of people walk around and around taking in colorful new views at every turn.
Eliasson, the Danish-Icelandic artist of Your Rainbow Panorama, was reputedly inspired by Dante’s Divine Comedy and finally reaching the perfection of Paradise. He created Your Rainbow Panorama to add to something that was already there (the view of Aarhus) and to make people think about where art ends and the museum begins."	This colorful artistic feature atop a Danish art gallery allows visitors to stroll through a rainbow.
