Muhammad Ali Gravesite	['sports', 'cemeteries']	299	422	"Aptly nicknamed “The Greatest,” boxing heavyweight champion, humanitarian, philanthropist, and civil rights leader Muhammad Ali was born in Louisville, Kentucky. He was buried in the city’s historic Cave Hill Cemetery. The site contains two granite benches where visitors can sit and reflect on the greatness of Ali. The boxing legend was buried on his side, facing east in accordance to his Islamic faith.
The memorial’s inscription reads: “He took a few cups of love, he took one tablespoon of patience, one teaspoon of generosity, one pint of kindness. He took one quart of laughter, one pinch of concern, and then he mixed willingness with happiness, he added lots of faith and he stirred it up well. Then he spread it over a span of a lifetime and he served to each and every person he met.”"	One of the greatest boxers and humanitarians to ever live chose his hometown as his final resting place.
