Panorama Point	['state high points', 'fauna', 'geographic markers', 'animals']	155	507	"South of the town of Kimball, near where Nebraska, Wyoming, and Colorado meet, stands Panorama Point, the highest point in Nebraska.
A wide open vista extends out to the plains, and on a clear day one can see the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains to the southwest.
The point is on the grounds of the High Point Bison Ranch. Formerly, the bison were allowed to roam free but now they are behind fences. Should a bison be in the road, be patient, do not scare it, and let it move on. At the gate before the point, a kiosk with envelopes will accept the entry fee of $3 per person.
This area also contains many windmills to harvest the strong winds prevalent in the area."	Roaming bison and a spectacular view at the highest point in Nebraska.
