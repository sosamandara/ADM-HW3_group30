George Boedecker's Sculpture Garden	['sculpture gardens', 'sculptures', 'animals']	171	866	"Croc’s shoe co-founder George Boedecker Jr. has created a sculpture menagerie in the neighborhood of Bellevue. A tiger, bear and other sculptures are on display around the property. Surrounded by trees, a pond, and trail this it’s truly a sight to behold. Boedecker plans to expand the driveway to make the area more accessible to visitors, whilst adding more dinosaurs.
The sculptures were made by an artist he met in Mexico while visiting the country on business. The entire project was done with his grandchildren and the community around Nashville in mind."
