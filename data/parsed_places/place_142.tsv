Polcari's Coffee	['Unique Restaurants & Bars']	402	716	"It’s hard not to get excited by all the bins and jars of colorful ingredients at Polcari’s Coffee on Salem Street.
They’ve been vending spices and coffee beans since 1932, when Ralph Polcari saved up enough money to put his dream of owning a coffee shop into action. The shop also has a wide assortment of other fun things like bulk  herbs, pasta, nuts – plus walls full of vintage copper coffee pots, family photos, and other eye candy that makes this shop a bit of a museum of the family business.
In fact, that’s how current owner Bobby Eustace, virtually a son of Mr. Polcari, sees it. He worked with the family for twenty-six years before taking the shop over several years ago. “I consider myself a museum keeper, committed to running this business with Mr. Polcari, Ralph and the rest of their family in mind.” Don’t be afraid to ask about the wide assortment of coffee beans available - and don’t miss their Lemon Slushes made outside the shop during the summer."	Shelves covered in dozens of coffee bean varieties fill this North End institution.
