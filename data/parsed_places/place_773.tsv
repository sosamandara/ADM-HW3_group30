Tail of the Dragon	['national parks', 'roads']	406	528	"Highway 129 crosses along the beautiful, rugged southwestern border of the Great Smokey Mountains National Park. The highway’s collection of turns and bends have earned it the nickname “Dragon’s Tail.” Along this stretch of road are drastic curves with names such as “Beginner’s End” and “Gravity Cavity.” These nicknames aren’t meant to be taken lightly, as accidents along the highway are frequent. 
Commercial trucks with a trailer longer than 30 feet are forbidden from operating along this stretch of highway. Truck drivers may even lose their commercial driver’s license for attempting to traverse the dangerous highway. With this lack of commercial traffic, Highway 129 is a tempting destination for motorcycle and sports car lovers from across the globe.
The highway is so popular that several companies run photo services along the route catering to adventurous motorists. Simply drive the road on any summer day and your photo will be taken numerous times and available to purchase online. 
The route was originally used by the native Cherokee and herds of roaming buffalo before it become an official Tennessee route in the 1920s. The road was named TN72 on the Tennessee side. It was seldom used until the mid-1990s, when motorcycle and sport car communities began to take notice.
At the southern end of the roadway in North Carolina, two permanent stores across from each other offer a number of souvenirs, t-shirts, and cold drinks.  It’s considered bad luck by some to buy souvenirs or put dragon stickers on your vehicle until you’ve actually traversed the road safely. The shops are seasonal and are only open during the spring and summer months.  During these months anticipate heavy traffic along the popular roadway."	This winding road of 318 curves is a must-visit for (careful) motorcycle and sports car enthusiasts.
