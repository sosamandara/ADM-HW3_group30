Río Celeste	['waterfalls', 'rivers', 'water']	161	744	"Nestled in the Costa Rican wilderness, the Rio Celeste is a stunning tropical gem whose iconic blue hue has turned it into a popular nature spot. 
Located amidst the forests of the Tenorio Volcano National Park the long river twists and turns through the wilderness maintaining its bright cerulean color all the way. The river gets its coloration from a mixture of sulfur and calcium carbonate which are seeded into the water from the nearby volcano. Along the river there are multiple hot springs and an impressive waterfall, all the same, seemingly unnatural blue. Pictures of the waters are regularly accused of being photoshopped or invented, but the simple chemistry in the river’s depths is very real, as countless hikers experience each year."	This neon blue river gets its color from a unique mix of bacteria and volcano minerals.
