Supersense	['camera obscura', 'curio cabinets', 'smells', 'pinball', 'wonder cabinets', 'coffee', 'mansions', 'photography', 'technology', 'architecture']	155	539	"A cafe in Vienna leads to a hipster cabinet of curiosities that includes an operational letterpress, massive analog photos, hand-cut vinyl records, a recording studio, and a large collection of scents.
Supersense is housed in a neo-Gothic mansion built in 1898. The ornate Art Nouveau designs offer a fitting backdrop for the analog-obsessed shop. There are typewriters with paper throughout the place, and one of the most technologically advanced things in there is a pinball machine that’s rigged to take a polaroid photo once a high score is achieved.
After having coffee and pastries, visitors can record a 90-second vinyl record in a modified elevator, or have their portrait taken with what Supersense says is the “world’s largest historic polaroid camera.” The photo department is filled with analog cameras and film, and offers tintypes as well as the large format instant photos.
A scent lab was developed in cooperation with Norwegian artist Sissel Tolaas who began her smell archive of over 7,000 airtight jars of scents in the 1990s. The shop sells a kit she designed for enhancing memory with olfactory triggers.
The printing press can make postcards and business cards, and, besides the elevator recording studio, there’s a full studio with a large collection vintage guitars and synthesizers."	A neo-Gothic mansion now houses a wunderkammer of analog tech that hits on all the senses.
