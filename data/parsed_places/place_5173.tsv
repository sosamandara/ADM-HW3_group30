HÃ¶llgrotten Caves	['caves', 'natural wonders', 'ecosystems', 'nature']	123	921	"The cave system consists of twisted, tangled stone formations and murky subterranean lakes that take hours to fully explore.
The Swiss location has become such a legendary draw, the caves are lit with eery lights and adorned with safe footpaths to make it safe and appealing for visitors. As a result, these strange and fascinating caverns have become something of a tourist attraction, with tours and guides readily available."	These spooky and unusual stone formations create an underworldly landscape.
