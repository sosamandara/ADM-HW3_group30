The Bone Room is a fascinating natural history/curiosity store in North Berkeley that sells all manner of mammal, bird, reptile, and fish bones, human bones, mounted insects, feathers, fossils, strange artwork, and many other types of animal curiosities. Each visit can provide one with some sort of new find, each time stranger than the last. The retail store is often a destination for travelers, artists, crafts people, and awe-struck school children.
“Created in 1987 by Ron Cauble, who simply wanted an excuse to learn more about Natural History…Though Ron could claim to be a professional in at least one field, he proudly affirms his amateur status with bones, insects and fossils. He asserts that ‘amateur’ is a dignified and important title. He likes to remind us that it means ‘lover’, and that the world needs more amateurs…and more lovers.”"	A store that sells all manner of bones, insects, and animal curiosities.
