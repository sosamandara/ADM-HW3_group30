Lake Michigan Triangle	['hoaxes and pseudoscience', 'shipwrecks', 'intriguing environs', 'mystery', 'ecosystems']	211	638	"Besides the Bermuda Triangle, few areas in the world have a reputation for the bizarre like the Lake Michigan  Triangle. Although it is relatively unknown on a global scale, especially compared to Bermuda, it has as storied a history of the unexplained as any place on earth.
Stretching from Ludington to Benton Harbor, Michigan and to Manitowoc, Wisconsin, the Lake Michigan Triangle has inspired numerous accounts of activity that are difficult to explain by rational thought. The mystery began in 1891, when a schooner named the Thomas Hume set off across the Lake to pick up lumber. Almost overnight in a torrent of wind, the Thomas Hume disappeared along with its crew of seven sailors. The wooden boat was never found, and extensive search failed to recover even a piece of driftwood.
After the turn of the century, strange events happened at steady intervals. Of the more mysterious is the case of the Rosa Belle. In 1921 eleven people inside the ship, who were all members of the Benton Harbor House of David, disappeared and their ship was found overturned and floating in Lake Michigan. While it appeared that the ship had been damaged in a collision, no other ship had reported an accident and no other remains had been found. Many found the incident particularly eerie because the Rosa Belle had been rebuilt after an earlier wreck in the 19th century, very similar to the deadly one in 1921.
As legend around these incidents grew, reports flew in from around the triangle claiming that a variety of strange occurrences happened during passage through the area. Some claimed the triangle was a time portal and that it either slowed or sped up time immensely during passage. Others maintained that UFOs were seen in the area, or reported bright lights in the sky.
Over the years, chilling personal accounts bolstered the legend, and soon many were writing about strange weather phenomena, or even just feeling a great uneasiness when navigating inside the swath of lake. Throughout the 20th century, thousands made their way through the triangle and they have yet to document anything supernatural. Although personal experiences have varied, the legend has grown powerful enough as an entity unto itself to keep many away from the triangle.
Whether out of general caution, or real fear of being the next to disappear, the superstitious make careful navigation to avoid the Lake Michigan Triangle."	Paranormal activity on the great lakes.
