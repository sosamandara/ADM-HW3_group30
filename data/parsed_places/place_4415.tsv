Vinegar Hill	['intriguing environs', 'ecosystems']	482	729	"Located just off the York Street subway stop and just steps from DUMBO, you can visit a slice of 19th century Brooklyn in Vinegar Hill. Its 18th-century developers named it after a battle in the Irish Rebellion, to attract immigrants from that country to the area, who were needed as workers at the nearby Brooklyn Navy Yard.
Long-time residents of the neighborhood fought for and won Historic District status after St. Ann’s, the neighborhood’s beautiful historic church, was demolished by a real estate developer in the 1990s. The land where the church, built in 1860, stood, remains a vacant lot at the corner of Gold Street and Front Street. Consolidated Edison, Inc., the citywide power company, also demolished many houses in the neighborhood in order to facilitate laying underground power lines, and today reserves exclusive use of the waterfront in this neighborhood for its main Brooklyn power substation. 
The neighborhood has seen waves of change as families arrived from Eastern Europe and the South in search of a better life, and today the neighborhood is a quiet, diverse alcove of artists and professionals nestled between the Navy Yard, the Con-Ed substation, and noisier, busier DUMBO.
Although the neighborhood has seen significant erosion of its historical area, the Belgian block cobblestone streets and Greek Revival row houses are distinct reminders of the past. Hudson Avenue, the shady, tree-lined cobblestone street now contains the longest contiguous stretch of the Vinegar Hill historic district, and probably gives the best impression of what the neighborhood must have been like nearly two hundred years ago. On quiet evenings in Vinegar Hill, the memory of those first Irish residents surely still echoes in the stones and wooden-walled houses still sloping down toward the waterfront today."
