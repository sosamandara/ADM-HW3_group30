Those on a quick trip to the city will likely breeze through the historical spots without stopping to take in the hidden details.
Those who do choose to examine the Korean War Veterans Memorial with an eagle eye will be rewarded with a small canine surprise. If you search hard enough while looking at the Mural Wall, you’ll find a soldier with his German Shepherd.
This particular military dog may not be so easy to spot, as the image is only about two inches tall. Still, trying to find the concealed canine is a powerful experience, as it’ll make you remember the soldiers and animals who served in the war.
The U.S. Army estimates its forces employed around 1,500 dogs during the war. They mainly worked as sentry dogs and were trained to silently warn their human controllers about any possible intruders. The dogs didn’t return home with their handlers after the end of the war, to the great sadness of the men who had grown to love them.
The Mural Wall is one of the many parts of the Korean War Veterans Memorial in Washington D.C. Louis Nelson used over 2,000 photographic images that were sandblasted into 100 tons of polished “Academy Black” granite to create this segment of the iconic monument."	Those with a sharp eye can find the hidden image of a German Shepherd on the memorial's Mural Wall.
