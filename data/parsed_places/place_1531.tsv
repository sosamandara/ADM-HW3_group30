U.S. Army Medical Department Museum	['medical museums', 'military history', 'collections', 'military', 'museums and collections', 'museums']	172	594	"Built using private donations, the U.S. Army Medical Department Museum is a collection of military medical artifacts and memorabilia showcasing contributions to medicine during wartime and peace. Existing since 1862 in one form or another, the museum now resides at Fort Sam, a military base in San Antonio, Texas.
Along with presenting exhibits on frontline medicine, specialized fields, and other specifics of military medicine, the collection includes a fantastic selection of vintage war photos, antique medical equipment, and military vehicles used by medics in every conflict the U.S. has been involved in, all the way back to the Civil War.
One of the more impressive relics is the hospital train, which was used in the Korean War. Left over from WWII, the hospital trains played a vital role in medical evacuation and treatment, until the dramatic increase of air evacuation techniques. The Korean War was the last conflict in which the trains were used, and they were sold off or stored once the war ended.
The U.S Army Medical Department Museum is open to the public. Admission is free, but they encourage donations and a visit to the gift shop."	This museum showcases the history and contributions of the U.S. Army to the medical industry, both on the battlefield and off.
