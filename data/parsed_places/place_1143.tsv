Instead, she resorted to using pictures, each worth 1,000 words, to introduce her reader s to this one-of-a-kind gift store.
Tail of the Yak specializes in ephemera, new and antique decorative arts, gifts, and antique jewelry. Some more specific examples, which provide a fairly strong image of what visitors might find in this store, where the goods on display are ever-changing: paper whimsies, wrapping paper, French soaps and glassware, and even peace and love doves. Yes, real doves that live in a cage in the middle of the store."	Handmade treasures from around the world.
