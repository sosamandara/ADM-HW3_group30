Grave of Andy Warhol	['celebrity', 'graves', 'gravestones', 'cemeteries', 'art']	170	702	"A site of pilgrimage for many art fans, Andy Warhol continues to be part of popular media as his gravesite is broadcast 24 hours a day on his museum’s website.
Andy Warhol once said, “I never understood why when you died, you didn’t just vanish, and everything could just keep going on the way it was only you just wouldn’t be there. I always thought I’d like my own tombstone to be blank. No epitaph and no name.
Well, actually, I’d like it to say “figment.”
The famous artist is buried in St. John the Baptist Byzantine Catholic Cemetery near the western Pennsylvania towns of Bethel Park and Castle Shannon. His grave is now the target of two cameras that feed their images to a page on the Andy Warhol Museum’s website — a project called “Figment.”
Fans are known to bring cans of Campbell’s Soup and other bits of pop culture ephemera to the gravesite."	The pop art icon's gravesite is broadcast 24 hours a day on his museum's website.
