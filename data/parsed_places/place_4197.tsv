Reader's Oasis Books	['bookstores', 'books', 'shops']	107	567	"Near the Arizona border, there’s an oasis. Although completely unusual, it is not a mirage. It’s Reader’s Oasis Books. The warning signs outside the bookstore advise customers to expect to see nudity within. While there are some vintage gentleman’s magazines inside, that’s not what those signs are referring to.
Proprietor Paul “Sweet Pie” Winer has been running his desert bookstore for decades wearing only a custom crocheted sock (not on either foot) and little else to cover his extremely tanned hide. 
There’s no air-conditioning, so you might want to join Paul in removing some articles of clothing while you browse the thousands of titles filling the sprawling stacks and shelves of the shop. On a hot day, you’ll realize Sweet Pie is the most sensibly dressed.
Sweet Pie is not only a book-loving nudist, he’s also an accomplished musician. He will regularly close the register to sit at his piano and play a few songs for customers. You can find his music for sale in the shop. He has some great stories and enjoys taking pictures with customers to promote the store.
Update as of November 2019: The owner of the shop, Sweet Pie, passed away in May of 2019. The future of the store is uncertain."	The shop's owner has spent decades in the desert wearing nothing but a strategically placed sock.
