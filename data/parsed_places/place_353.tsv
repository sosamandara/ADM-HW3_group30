U.S. Route 1 Mile 0 Sign	['tourism', 'roads', 'roadside attractions']	1066	434	"Located on an otherwise unassuming street corner, this Mile 0 marker garners perhaps just as much love from tourists, bikers, travelers, and highway enthusiasts as its Route 66 counterpart.
U.S. Route 1 stretches from Key West, Florida, more than 2,000 miles to Fort Kent, Maine, not far from the United States-Canada border. The highway connects several major cities along the eastern seaboard such as Boston, Washington, D.C., and Portland, Maine. It’s also commonly referred to as the Overseas Highway in Florida, as it stretches out across the Florida Keys.
Not far from the famous marker is the End of the Road Gift Shop, a small souvenir store dedicated to the green and white sign. Inside, visitors can buy cups and other souvenirs featuring the mile marker sign. Not far from the marker is the Southernmost Point Buoy, which indicates the southernmost point of the continental United States. The buoy also states that from that point it’s just a mere 90 miles to Cuba."	The highway's southernmost spot is a beloved local attraction.
