Moose Cheese	['expensive eats', 'rare foods', 'dairy', 'milk', 'cheese', 'meat', 'farms']	44	425	"Moose-milking can’t be easy. Perhaps that’s why moose milk cheese can set a buyer back as much as $500 per pound, making it one of the most expensive cheeses in the world. But for those with a druthers for dairy, The Elk House (Europeans call their moose “elk”) in Bjurholm, Sweden, makes four varieties of the pricey product, all thanks to three moose sisters.
Gullan, Haelga, and Juno lactate only from May through the end of September. Coaxing the five liters of milk from each moose per day takes a delicate hand and calm demeanor, which leads to the product’s prestige and price. The Johanssons, who own the Elk House farm, make four kinds of cheese from the high-protein milk: a soft, white-mold variety similar to Camembert; a creamy blue cheese; a dried blue cheese; and feta. The latter, which gets preserved in a neutral vegetable oil, is the Elk House’s bestseller. Some reviewers say the feta has a mildly acidic flavor and smooth texture. While some of the varieties are available at select restaurants scattered across the country, that’s as far as they travel. All the more reason to visit the Elk House’s farm and pay respects to these fine lactating ladies."	A Swedish farm is the world's only producer of this rare, creamy delicacy.
