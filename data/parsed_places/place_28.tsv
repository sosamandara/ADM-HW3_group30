There’s also a menagerie of exotic animal remains, including some vintage taxidermy, as well as prehistoric dinosaur fossils, and ritualist artifacts like necromancer’s masks and cannibal trophies. (The shop points out that all the objects are legally and ethically collected.) The shop space is shared with a large education center called the Prehistoria Museum. 
Update as of March 2022 The storefront has reopened post-Covid lockdowns."	A collection of human remains, animal body parts, and other macabre curiosities all legally for sale.
