The Awakening II	['sculptures']	161	408	This 70-foot aluminum statue depicts a giant man attempting to escape his dirt prison. This is actually the second casting of the giant man. The original was created by sculptor Seward Johnson for the 11th annual Sculpture Conference in Washington D.C. around 1980. It was then installed at Hains Point, before being moved to the National Harbor in Maryland. Seward later decided to create a duplicate sculpture that now calls Chesterfield Central Park home.	A sculpture of a giant man escaping from the depths of the Earth.
