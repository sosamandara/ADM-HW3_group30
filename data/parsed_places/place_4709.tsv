Penobscot Narrows Bridge and Observatory	['observatories', 'bridges']	618	543	"While there are innumerable bridges and observation towers scattered around the planet, it’s considerably more rare to witness the combination of these two lovely structures.
There are only a handful of bridge observatories in the world, and this 2,120-foot-long cable suspension bridge over the Penobscot River (aka “the Narrows”) between Verona Island and Prospect, Maine is home to one of the them. The Penobscot Narrows Bridge and Observatory has the distinction of being the first bridge observation tower in the U.S. as well as the tallest public bridge observatory in the world. 
The bridge itself is a beautiful sight and worth a stop while driving along Route 1 in itself, and the 420-foot-high observation tower makes it all the better. Taking the elevator up 42 stories to the observation room you’re met with beautiful 360-degree views of the river and bay below, the nearby village of Bucksport, and the historic Fort Knox, which, built in 1844, is one of the best preserved fortifications on the New England seacoast. Some say it’s the best view in Maine."	The first bridge observation tower in the U.S. offers one of the best views of Maine.
