Graffiti Alley	['street art', 'art outside', 'graffiti', 'murals']	423	446	"Located within Toronto’s Fashion District, Graffiti Alley runs parallel to the trendy stretch of Queen Street West. It encompasses three city blocks and includes the contiguous alleyway of Rush Lane. It’s a popular spot to view some of the best examples of Toronto’s vibrant street art and mural culture.
Previously a hotspot for unsanctioned graffiti art, Graffiti Alley sparked a fight for legalization by the Queen Street West Business Improvement Association. In 2011, it was designated as an area of municipal significance, and StreetARToronto, or StART, a program that provides funding and approval for public murals and graffiti art, was born from the struggle.
Today, Graffiti Alley is a popular backdrop for photoshoots, as well as a place to see works by iconic artists like Duro the Third, uber5000, and ELICSER. It has served as the venue for small street festivals, a set for music videos, and for a time, had a restaurant named after it."	A fantastic place to see murals, and an important location in the history of Toronto's legal street art scene.
