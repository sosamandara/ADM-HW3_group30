Old Ballard Liquor Co.	['Unique Restaurants & Bars', 'shops']	120	441	"In a city overcrowded with beer breweries, the Old Ballard Liquor Company offers some delightfully different spirits made from fresh ingredients.
Opened in 2013 by local entrepreneur and former boat worker Lexi, the Ballard-based craft liquor business has a laboratory atmosphere with bottles and jars full of fermenting fruits and other ingredients as the brewery searches for crisp new flavors. The young company’s flagship drink is a variation on a historic libation known as the “cherry bounce,” a cherry-infused liquor with a higher-than-normal alcohol content. Old Ballard’s Cherry Bounce, however, uses a rare variety of cherry known as the “sour pie cherry” to create a distinct flavor all its own. Lexi plans on expanding their line of spirits to include vodkas and aquavits in the future.
For the time being, anyone wanting to visit the operation and try Old Ballard’s unique drinks can locate tasting room hours on their Facebook page and head down to the waterfront warehouse that serves as their base of operations.  Be sure to stop in and learn all about distillery and vodka infusions!"
