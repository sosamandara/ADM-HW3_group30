Kulturtårnet	['culture', 'hidden', 'bridges', 'restaurants', 'shops', 'food']	132	587	"Found by walking across the Christianshavn side of the Knippelsbro bridge, this bright teal yet unassuming river tower turned cafe is almost submarine-like as it sits at the side of the harbor. Most people find this gem by accident while walking across the bridge; many Danes don’t even know of its existence.  
The river tower itself has been around for 80 years, but the cafe found its home here just a few years ago. The tower operates as a place for the community to come together for cultural events and good food. Once you spot the tower with the big white flag, run over and grab a coffee while taking in the sights and sounds of Copenhagen. 
Walk up the lit staircase and you’ll come across two dining rooms before reaching the outdoor tables and chairs. Sitting on the deck is peaceful and the atmosphere inside is cozy and fun. It is highly recommended to talk with the staff and creator, they have interesting stories to share and may even teach you a few Danish words."	A little-known cafe in an old copper bridge tower with 360-degree views of the harbor.
