Virginia City consists of territorial shops, hotels, and even a opera house that performs turn of the century theatre and vaudeville. You can tour Boot Hill and also take a Ghost Tour after dark. They also host a festival and ball each summer where everyone dresses in Civil War era clothes.
As a bonus, you’ll also find one of the best old-time candy stores in Montana there."	An entire town preserved as a historic landmark.
