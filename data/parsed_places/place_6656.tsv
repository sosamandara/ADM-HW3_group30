KokoMantis	['metal', 'sculptures']	165	411	"The KokoMantis is a 22-foot long, 17-foot high sculpture created by scrap artist Scott Pitcher in 2012. It’s located at the corner of Washington St. and Sycamore St., in the downtown area of Kokomo, IN.
The torso and wings were fashioned from World War II fuel pontoons and the legs were composed of traffic light poles. It took a reported 220 hours to create and position this unique sculpture. Don’t try to ride her, however, she also sports a sign that says “please do not climb me; I’m ticklish!” The KokoMantis even has its own Facebook and Twitter profiles."	Along this stretch of Indiana roadway resides a giant insect composed entirely of scrap metal.
