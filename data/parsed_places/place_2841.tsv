Studio Antiques	['purveyors of curiosities', 'intriguing environs', 'ecosystems', 'collections']	67	475	"Studio Antiques is a veritable treasure trove of the old and weird.
But it’s not your standard, everyday antique store. The owners are featured on the show Baggage Battles on the travel channel and their website looks very “normal” but when you visit the store itself it’s a different story.
The interior of the building is crammed floor to ceiling with dusty relics of the past. You have to navigate narrow pathways of furniture and display cases piled high with every manner of treasure. There is no rhyme or reason to the organization.
You might find an old barber chair sitting next to a cigar store indian who is wearing a beaded Victorian shawl. Look closely or you might miss something! The controlled chaos extends out to the enclosed patio and here is where the fun begins!
The patio is dominated by the owners’ eclectic vision of an Old West ghost town. The building is covered with all manner of broken chairs, lamps, statues and the like. Everything in the store is for sale, including the ghost town itself, which is listed on Ebay for $23,500.00.  The best part of the experience is making a purchase because all prices are negotiable!"	Made famous by cable TV, this oddball collection of antiques and collectibles is a cut above the rest.
