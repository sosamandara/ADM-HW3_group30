Tempest Freerunning Academy	['wondrous performances', 'repositories of knowledge', 'cultures and civilizations']	101	558	"Tempest Freerunning Academy looks like a cross between a gymnasium, a Ninja Warrior obstacle course, and a level from Super Mario Brothers, which would be an accurate description, for that’s exactly what it is.
The lovechild of an X Games ramp designer and a LA-based freerunning team, The Tempest Freerunning Academy is the first facility in California dedicated to teaching the art of freerunning and parkour. For those unfamiliar,  freerunning and parkour refers to the art and the sport of running, jumping, flipping and balancing on various objects and over obstacles while traveling from point A to point B.
Contrary to popular belief, freerunning and parkour are actually different activities, the former being subset of the latter. While parkour focuses on the efficiency of movement around obstacles, freerunning focuses on the aesthetics of movement. If the acrobatics of freerunning intimidate you, you can always settle for some more practical movements of parkour, and vice versa if you’re feeling more daring.
The academy offers classes for all ages and skill levels. The classes are split up by skill level and age, so you can learn the basics with in less intimidating peer groups. If you are already well-versed in freerunning and parkour, the facility offers open gym hours, and hosts the occasional “jam”, a large gathering of parkour traceurs and freerunners for the purpose of training and socializing."	An academy where anyone can train in the exciting acrobatic sports of parkour and freerunning.
