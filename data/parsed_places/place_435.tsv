Alain Baroux's Antique Curiosity Cabinet	['curio cabinets', 'wonder cabinets', 'purveyors of curiosities', 'stores']	63	621	"Located in the famous Marche Vernaison, Baroux’s Antique Curiosity Cabinet is a cornucopia of marvels, and will amaze even the most jaded of curio lovers. Alain Baroux’s antique curiosity cabinet is full of treasures and positively overwhelming in its sheer amount of things to look at and admire.   
For several decades, Monsieur Baroux has sold naturalia, exotica and other traditional curiosity cabinet items, but Monsieur Baroux has an even more unusual specialty. Baroux is renowned for the self-made cryptozoologic creations that hide in his shop, and is the only hybrid taxidermist of the Parisian flea market, transforming dusty mounts into fantastic creatures that will make the standard two-headed duckings and jackalopes pale in comparision.
If you are a passionate collector or simply short on artistic inspiration, this is a mandatory stop on your Parisian strolls."	An antique curios dealer and hybrid taxidermist.
