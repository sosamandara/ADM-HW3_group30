Underground Church of Saint-Jean at Aubeterre-sur-Dronne	['catacombs and crypts', 'subterranean sites', 'sacred spaces']	67	636	"The Church of Saint-Jean is an impressively huge subterranean church, hand-hewn out of a rock hillside in the 12th century.
In the main room, two massive columns rise up to a nearly 60-foot-high ceiling. A winding stairway, also hewn out of the rock, allows visitors to climb up through the back wall to passages at the top that provide a beautiful view of the main room through a series of windows and overlooks.
It was originally built to house religious artifacts; to the side of the main room is a Roman reliquary that was apparently discovered during the first Crusade. Off of the main room is a necropolis containing over 80 sarcophagi."	The largest underground church in Europe.
