Aurland Lookout	['natural wonders', 'nature', 'architectural oddities', 'architecture']	149	449	"The Aurland Lookout towers nearly 2,000 feet above the scenic landscape of Aurland, Norway.
Designed by architects Todd Saunders and Tommie Wilhelmsen in 2005, the wooden structure juts out over one of the most expansive fjords on Norway’s west coast.
The 14-foot-wide wooden platform spans 110 horizontal feet from the treetops before dramatically plunging downwards, giving visitors the illusion of falling into the landscape. Thankfully, a thin pane of glass prevents visitors from slipping off the edge, as well as provides them with a breathtaking view while suspended over the mountainside.
Due to its abrupt “drop,” the lookout has earned nicknames such as “ski jump” and “diving board.” But offering reassurance, architect Wilhelmsen writes: “It is meant to be scary, but the structure and glass are very safe.”"	A thin pane of glass keeps visitors from sliding off this futuristic skywalk.
