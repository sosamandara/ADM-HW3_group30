Overgrown Ship Hulk	['ships', 'roadside attractions', 'ruins']	212	1015	"Built in 1917 during the shipbuilding boom of World War I, the schooner La Merced carried petroleum products for Standard Oil. Like other big ships, she was eventually used as a cannery in Alaska.
She was then scuttled in 1966 and now lives out her days in this lonely boatyard in Anacortes. The overgrown ship is visible from the road, and makes for a striking image, covered in trees and wildlife. The ship was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.
You can access the ship from the marina parking lot, but be warned that this is an active marina, with at least one person living in a houseboat, so be respectful. You can walk right up to the boat on a footpath or take pictures from the adjacent beach at low tide."	This dilapidated ship carcass covered in trees is a striking sight.
