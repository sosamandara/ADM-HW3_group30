Old Shoreditch Station	['railroads', 'restaurants', 'Unique Restaurants & Bars', 'shops']	338	680	"Old Shoreditch Station Coffee Shop is much more than just a coffee shop. The shop converts into a bar in the evenings and features a food menu, but more interestingly, it serves as a space where artists can exhibit their work and music fans can catch a gig.
The venue is sponsored by Jaguar Shoes Collective, an affiliation of businesses and individuals working toward promoting local art, including visual and musical offerings. The space also serves as a place for product line launches and is a prime spot for people watching in the bustling Shoreditch district in London’s East End."	Once a train station along the Great Eastern Railway this vibrant coffee shop and bar is where members of London’s creative class mingle.
