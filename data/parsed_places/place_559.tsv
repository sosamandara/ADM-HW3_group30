Free Little Library (#0924)	['libraries']	194	445	"On a small road to the beach in the middle of a big city is Free Little Library #0924.
As you head west on Montana Avenue (towards the Pacific Ocean) the box containing the books is partially hidden by some tall shrubbery. As you head east, however, the box is clearly visible on your right. 
A sign affixed to the box labels it as the Little Free Library, official charter #0924. The sign encourages patrons to borrow a book, while also reminding them to return a book.
The library represents a worldwide movement of free libraries placed in visible areas, accessible to anyone. On the website of the Little Free Library, the idea behind the movement is explained: “If this were just about providing free books on a shelf, the whole idea might disappear after a few months. Little Free Libraries have a unique, personal touch and there is an understanding that real people are sharing their favorite books with their community.”
There is a map on the official website showing the locations of free libraries around the world. There might be one in your neighborhood. As for Free Little Library #0924, it is not on the official map. Given that not all things worth finding are marked on an official map, it might be best to wander through your neighborhood, keeping an eye out for things like this hidden just out of view."	A free library to stumble across, one of many placed worldwide if you know where to look.
