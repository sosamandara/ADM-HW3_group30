Calvert Vaux Cove	['trash', 'boats', 'beaches', 'hidden', 'abandoned']	126	722	"There are hidden gems throughout New York City, and this is no exception. A derelict boat wades gently in the cove of the Gravesend Bay, retired from its former life as a mode of transportation. The rusted, overturned vessel floats among rubbish while trees hang overhead and graffiti lay still as a backdrop.
The bay is on the edge of Calvert Vaux Park and a car junkyard. A small path leads the curious adventurer down a slope, through tall brush that reveals the hidden beach. You’d assume fine grain sand would cover the landscape and bleed into the water, but this is not the case. Quite the opposite, this site features large, slippery rocks, red bricks, big chunks of asphalt from unknown streets, and trash, as if it were Brooklyn’s personal disposal bin."	This small, hidden cove is home to abandoned boats.
