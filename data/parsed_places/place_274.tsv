Founded by miniature setting artist Dan Ohlmann, the museum holds over a thousand pieces of down-scaled locations such as a school room and a fully-furnished dining room which are so detailed that they could pass for their full-size inspirations. The site also includes such tiny tchotchkes as carved matchsticks, chiseled egg shells, and micro-origami. In addition to all of the tiny pieces of sculpture the museum’s other focus is on special effects and creatures from the movies. In this section of the museum visitors can see props and costumes from such films as I, Robot, Stuart Little, and Hellboy. Even with all of the micro amazements, the excitement the Musée Miniature et Cinéma is immense."	Monsters and miniatures are held in equal esteem at this wondrous museum.
