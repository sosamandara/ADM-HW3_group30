'Moonrise Kingdom' Beach	['new england', 'beaches', 'film locations']	151	425	"Though Wes Anderson’s 2012 movie Moonrise Kingdom was set on the fictional island of New Penzance, you can visit the site of Sam and Suzy’s romantic getaway in Rhode Island’s Fort Wetherill State Park, at the southern end of Conanicut Island.
The park was once home to Fort Wetherill, the largest fort of the Harbor Defenses of Narragansett Bay. It was an active base through World War II, but fell out of use after the war.  The state of Rhode Island acquired it in the early 1970s and repurposed it for recreational use.
Moonrise Kingdom details the journey of two teenagers, Sam and Suzy, who run away from home to embark on a summer adventure. They escape to a deserted beach where they dance, paint, pierce ears, and share their first kiss. 
Two of the park’s beaches were used as filming locations in the indie favorite. The beach where Sam and Suzy pitch their tent, dance, and jump off the rocks, and the beach where they discuss what they’d like to be when they grow up and write the words “Moonrise Kingdom” into the sand. 
So pack yourself your favorite novels, your Khaki Scout manual, and some 45s, and head off with your Sam or Suzy to this sweet secluded getaway."	The secluded beach getaway from Wes Anderson's dreamy summer romance.
