The Salt Palace	['wonders of salt', 'outsider architecture', 'geological oddities', 'natural wonders', 'collections', 'geology', 'nature', 'architectural oddities', 'architecture']	156	409	"In Grand Saline, where both the salt industry and the name of the town date back to 1845, salt is everything. Grand Saline sits above an estimated 16,000 foot deep natural salt deposit (a supply estimated to last 20,000 years), which is still mined by Morton.
The Salt Palace is actually the fourth salt palace to be built in the small town of Grand Saline, Texas. The first, built in 1936 was patterned after the Alamo as part of the State of Texas Centennial Celebration, the second, made of salt blocks, built in 1960 lasted a short time, the third, built in 1975 was built as the centerpiece of the annual Salt Festival. In 1993 it was replaced by the current Salt Palace and made to last.
Constructed entirely of rock salt, the Salt Palace houses a small museum which includes salt mining memorabilia and photographs, and a film of the Morton Salt mining operations at 750 feet underground. The museum is free. Visitors receive a salt crystal souvenir. Many visitors can’t resist licking the walls."	"A small ""palace"" and museum made of, and devoted entirely, to salt."
