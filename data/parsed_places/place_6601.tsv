Giant Cow Head	['monuments', 'statues']	204	458	"On top of the the former Ira Wilson & Sons Dairy building, a giant cow head surveys the landscape and attracts visitors–especially those interested in larger-than-life roadside attractions. There isn’t much else to see along this stretch on Detroit’s east end. 
The building was a popular ice cream parlor in the 1950s. Long after it closed, it received a jolt of publicity in 2002, when it was featured in the movie 8 Mile. The filmmakers gave the decrepit building a fresh coat of paint, but since production wrapped it has remained untouched and on the market since 2016."
