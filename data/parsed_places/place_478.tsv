Mmuseumm	['wonder cabinets', 'miniatures', 'collections', 'museums and collections', 'art', 'museums']	823	4769	"Pronounced “museum,” Mmuseumm is a curated display of artifacts housed in a freight elevator.
This tiny space features rotating and permanent collections, specializing in the “overlooked, dismissed, or ignored.” Museumm offers a unique opportunity to engage with familiar and exotic everyday objects from around the world. Past exhibitions include Personal Possessions found in the Pacific, Paper Works found in Copying Machines, and Homemade Weapons of Defense. 
Created by filmmakers Alex Kalman, Benny and Josh Safdie, and sponsored by the late Kate Spade (and Andy and Bea Spade) of the purse empire, among the unusual objects featured in the museum have been the shoe thrown at George W. Bush at the Minister’s Palace in Baghdad, a hot water coil heater from Kaunas, Lithuania, and a plastic glove from Paradise Valley, Montana.
The collection is refreshed annually. In 2018, a small “gift shop” was added in a window a few feet down on the right of the Mmuseumm. Visitors may call an 800 number to access a free audio guide. The museum fits three people at a time."	"A tiny museum housed in a New York freight elevator specializes in the ""overlooked, dismissed, or ignored."""
