Red Mountain Park	['natural wonders', 'nature']	278	447	"Alabamian’s roots run deep in red dirt, and Red Mountain Park in Birmingham, Alabama understands the value of this land. Consisting of more than 1500 acres stretching nearly five miles between the cities of Bessemer and Homewood, the park will make Birmingham the city in America with more green space per capita than any other.
This land marks the spot where Birmingham began, where iron ore miners of all backgrounds worked hard toward a common goal, to contribute to the growing city. 
The site of the park was the primary source for rich iron ore deposits that prompted the founding of Birmingham back in the 1870s, and the park takes its name from the mountain that it surrounds. Using the mountain and other geological features to support 20 miles of hiking trails, 50 acres of meadows, and a 22-acre fishing pond, Red Mountain Park wants to empower every visitor to reclaim this historic land."	This 1,500-acre development hopes to be the Central Park of the South.
