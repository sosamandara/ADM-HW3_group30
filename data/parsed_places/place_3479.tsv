But the inside is filled with a wide assortment of oddities that have drawn tourists from all over the country.
In the house, collections of vintage taxidermy - “rat bird” and “pigeon shark” are examples - Steampunk sculptures, various types of artwork, antique medical devices, rusty cleavers and other weaponry, coffins and more line the walls and fill the rooms. Trundle Manor also specializes in “dead things in jars,” according to the official website, which also notes that the house “prides itself on displaying genuine articles and not cheap Halloween props.” Specific items among those genuine articles include gas masks, animal skulls, and more.
“Anton Miriello and Rachel Rech have turned the place into a home so macabre it would make the Addams Family envious,” noted one newspaper story on the site. 
Also an artists’ residence, tours of Trundle Manor are by appointment only. Call 412-916-5544 to arrange a visit.
During the warmer months, the macabre menagerie of Trundle Manor hits the road in the operator’s ‘52 Dodge “Creep Rod,” named Trixy, with Trundle Manor’s Traveling Creepshow. The spectacle sees them set up a striped circus tent full of vintage sideshow wonders and bring a little slice of their creepy world to unsuspecting patrons."
