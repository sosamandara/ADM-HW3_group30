Black Veil Shoppe of Drear & Wonder	['jewelry', 'fairytales', 'shops']	172	997	Upon entering the black gabled walls, lit by flickering lanterns, the Black Veil Shoppe of Drear & Wonder is like stepping into a Grimm’s fairy-tale, where one may walk amid sprawling gardens, dripping stacks of candles, chandeliers, and secret passageways. The Black Veil also has plenty of photo-ops, and homes for many artist creators, apothecaries, and jewelers from around the globe. A beautifully grim experience for those coming to experience Salem, Massachusetts.	Like stepping into a spooky fairy-tale, this shop carries the dark ideas of artists and other makers.
