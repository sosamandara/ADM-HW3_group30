The Wadden Sea	['netherlands', 'sea', 'unesco', 'nature', 'animals']	199	440	"The Wadden Sea is a Unesco World Heritage site that consists of very shallow sea waters and stretches out from The Netherlands to Germany to Denmark.
Famous for its flora and animals, the Wadden Sea is an animal lover’s paradise. Home to thousands of birds, harbor seals, dolphins, and whales, it’s said that some regionally extinct species can still be found in the waters. 
Formed back in the 14th and 15th centuries by storms, the Wadden Sea landscape is the largest unbroken system of intertidal sand and mud flats in the world, according to the Unesco World Heritage. In fact, Wadden is derived from the Dutch word ‘wad,’ which translates to mud flats. 
As part of the landscape, the Wadden Sea is host to a series of islands known collectively as the Frisian Islands or the Wadden Islands. In the Netherlands, there are five islands—Texel, Terschelling, Vlieland, Ameland, and Schiermonnikoog—to visit.
Today, the islands are popular for “wadlopen” or mud flat walking. At low tide, nature-lovers can literally walk on the Wadden Sea, between islands, spotting lazy grey seals en route. A veritable mecca for nature, this area offers hiking and cycling trails, dunes, beaches, and ample wildlife."	Rich with fauna and flora, nature-lovers can walk across the sea at this UNESCO World Heritage spot.
