A Christmas Story House and Museum	['holiday', 'film locations', 'film', 'eccentric homes', 'homes', 'architectural oddities', 'museums and collections', 'architecture']	962	1551	"For many Americans, the 1983 film A Christmas Story is the platonic ideal of holiday entertainment, and the actual home used in the film is now restored to its cinema quality. There is even a museum devoted to the singular movie directly across the street.
The location itself was originally chosen due to its firmly mundane 1940s style and yet, thanks to the film, the simple abode is now one of the most iconic buildings in Western media, with Christmas decorations and tchotchkes paying homage to the famous facade. The owner of the house began by selling replica “leg lamps” like the one featured in A Christmas Story’s most memorable scene, and was eventually able to purchase the home from the movie. He has since completely remodeled the interior to be an exact replica of the home in the film. Visitors can walk through the period-modeled site, tasting the soap Ralphie washed his mouth out with or firing a BB gun in the backyard.
The museum across the street continues the obsession with the film and features a number of movie props such as little brother Randy’s snowsuit and all the toys from the department store window that Ralphie fawns over. If you can’t wait to watch A Christmas Story as it airs non-stop on cable this holiday, you can actually head to Cleveland and live the experience."	The home made famous by the 1983 holiday classic is now a perfectly preserved shrine to the movie.
