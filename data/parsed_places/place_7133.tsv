Geppi's Entertainment Museum	['comic books', 'toys', 'collections', 'museums and collections']	255	717	"It’s a unique place that can create a sentimental feeling of “back in the day,” for multiple generations. 85-year-old grandparents next to their college-aged grandchildren can both look back at the past with favor in the Geppi’s Entertainment Museum, where every inch is dedicated to nostalgic pop culture that resonates with every demographic.
Following the example set by the audience it appeals to, the Geppi’s Museum puts turn of the century comic characters next to Pez dispensers and life-sized Batman models. Although covering the breadth of American pop culture in a single museum is a daunting and seemingly chaotic task, the museum orders the mayhem in neat sections based on major historical events and innovations.
Starting from the very beginning, the museum features an exhibit on Baltimore’s earliest residents in the early 18th century. It then moves steadily through early 20th century newspapers, the Great Depression, television, and eventually multimedia and the internet. Whether you’re a fan of video games, Buster Brown, or just a history buff, the 16,000 square foot museum will have something that will pique your interest.
Update June 2018: Geppi’s Entertainment museum has closed.  The collection has been donated to the U.S. Library of Congress."	Walk through the history of American pop culture.
