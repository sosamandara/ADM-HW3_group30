Steinsdalsfossen Waterfall	['water']	127	592	"Steinsdalsfossen waterfall is one of the most visited attractions in Norway for good reason - it has a path behind it which allow visitors to have a closer look behind the falls. At night, the water is illuminated with purple and blue floodlights.
Steinsdalsfossen is 50 meters high, is located 2 kilometers east of Norheimsund, and belongs to Fosselva river.
It has been a popular destination for generations. For 25 years straight, missing only two seasons, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany made a trip to visit Steinsdalsfossen every summer. He only stopped at the outbreak of World War I.
The falls are active almost all year, but are most spectacular when the snow melts in May and June. Its unique location allows for tourists to take a look behind the waterfall as well, there is a small steep path leading up behind the fall. The powers of the water has been an inspiration for many plays and concerts during summer season."
