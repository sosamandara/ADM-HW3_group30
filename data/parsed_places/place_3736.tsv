Brookhurst Community Park	['playgrounds', 'parks']	164	473	"The Brookhurst Community Park in Orange County offers a number of rippling concrete playsets that look less like the work of a municipal planning community and more like the dreams of Dr. Seuss in cement.
In addition to the standard swing sets and slides, the park features wavering stone walkways and other organic forms rising from the ground to inspire imagination and play. 
BCP is a sprawling landscape of stalagmites, bridges, arches, and giant craters.  It is definitely more of a playground than a park and invites visitors to crawl over, under, and around the man-made Gaudian moonscape."	A surreal, Gaudi-inspired play space near an Anaheim community center.
