K’REX	"['world record', 'toys', 'dinosaurs', ""world's largest"", 'space exploration', 'animals', 'art', 'museums']"	151	408	"Though a plastic dinosaur may seem a bit out of place at a space center, that hasn’t stopped it from becoming a beloved, world recording-holding part of the museum. 
For a brief moment, the titan toy Tyrannosaurus rex was the largest K’Nex sculpture in the world.  The massive toy dinosaur, named K’REX, was made by Space Camp crew trainers during some of their spare time in the summer of 2011. It’s roughly 12 feet tall, 33 feet long, and nearly six feet wide. According to the Guinness World Records, 141,950 K’Nex pieces were used to craft the behemoth beast.
However, K’REX unfortunately couldn’t hang onto that particular title for very long. It was later eclipsed by a life-sized recreation of a Bloodhound Supersonic Car made from a whopping 350,000 K’Nex pieces.
But luckily for the dinosaur, the kind people at Guinness World Records found a way to let the toy reptile maintain some glory. They crowned K’REX the largest K’Nex skeleton sculpture, a specific title it still holds today.
The world-record holding dinosaur stands in all its plastic glory near the entrance and gift shop area at the U.S. Space and Rocket Center, where it greets visitors with a large toothy grin. There are also other smaller K’Nex models near the place you purchase tickets for admission."	This 12-foot-tall T-rex is the largest K’Nex skeleton sculpture in the world.
