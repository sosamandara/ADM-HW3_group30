An affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution, the National Museum of Dentistry is designated by Congress as the nation’s official museum of the dental profession.
Highlights of the collection include amazing teeth feats, George Washington’s not-so-wooden dentures (they were actually made from gold, ivory, lead, and human, horse and donkey teeth), Queen Victoria’s dental instruments, vintage toothpaste commercials, cartoon character toothbrushes, and the world’s only tooth jukebox.
We explored the National Museum of Dentistry on Obscura Day - March 20th, 2010.
