Musee Robert Tatin	['outsider architecture']	43	435	"Robert Tatin was the third in a line of Frenchmen who became obsessed with creating his own astounding living environment. Like Postman Cheval and Raymond Isidore before him, Robert Tatin too had a vision.
Tatin had worked as a sculptor, painter, architect, ceramicist, and poet, as well as a tailor, baker, carpenter, decorator, coal-man, and bartender. Tatin also traveled extensively and married five times. Five was the right number and he and his wife together created the Musee Robert Tatin, a house and museum of his elaborate sculptural work."	A self-built mosaic house and sculpture park.
