Cabezon Peak	['martian landscapes', 'hiking', 'volcanoes', 'mountains', 'legends', 'geological oddities', 'ecosystems', 'geology']	115	505	"With an elevation of nearly 8,000 feet, Cabezon Peak is the largest of over 50 dramatic volcanic formations that dot the otherwise barren and otherworldly desert shrubland of the Rio Puerco Valley.
Cabezon Peak is a steep-sided and symmetrical basalt volcanic plug that formed during the eruptions of the Mount Taylor volcanic field millions of years ago. The basalt monolith is one of the most prominent landmarks in northwestern New Mexico, dominating the landscape. (Visitors with a keen eye will notice it bears a striking similarity to the larger Devils Tower in Wyoming, which is also a basalt volcanic plug.)
Cabezon, which is derived from the Spanish and translates as “big head,” is believed to have religious significance for the local Pueblo and Navajo Indians. Numerous myths abound, but a particularly popular Navajo legend holds that a giant was slain on Mount Taylor, located to the west, and the giant’s severed head landed to the east, becoming Cabezon Peak. As the legend goes, the giant’s blood congealed to form the volcanic lava flows to the south.
The views from the summit of Cabezon Peak are impressive, looking out over much of northern and central New Mexico. Accordingly, the 1.9-mile hike to the top is a favorite among climbers. It is not, however, for the faint of heart. Basic mountain climbing experience and proper gear, including a helmet, are required for this technical climb along the scree-covered trail and up the nearly vertical cliffs. Acrophobes will definitely find this climb unpleasant."	This towering volcanic plug stands out among the dramatic formations that dot this otherworldly desert valley.
