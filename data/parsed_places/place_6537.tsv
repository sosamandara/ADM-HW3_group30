Kerr’s Run Colored School	['african-american', 'schools', 'black history', 'abandoned']	82	406	"Known only to the locals, this forgotten schoolhouse still stands in the oldest part of Pomeroy, Ohio. It is now boarded up and overgrown with brush. In its earlier days, it provided Black American children with a quality education, producing such notable figures as James Edwin Campbell, poet and first president of West Virginia State University, and James McHenry Jones, renowned educator and third president of West Virginia State University. It operated from the late 1880s to the early 1900s.
In 2007, to commemorate the bicentennial of Meigs County, a historical marker was added to the Kerr’s Run Colored School site. The sign briefly documents the history and legacy of the school."	This schoolhouse for Black American children is one of the oldest remaining in southeastern Ohio.
