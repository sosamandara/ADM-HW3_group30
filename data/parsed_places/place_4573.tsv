Montana Vortex and House of Mystery	['mystery spots and gravity hills', 'mystery']	121	500	This whimsical place is fun, weird and interesting even for the most sceptical. Step into the garden and the slanted House of Mystery—see and experiment for yourself! The one-hour tour is given by one of the owners but you’ll also have time to explore the mysteries and anomalies on your own.
