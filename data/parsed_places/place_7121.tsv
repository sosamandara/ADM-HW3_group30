Cathedral of Junk	['outsider architecture']	693	2479	"Tucked unsuspectingly in a suburban backyard in South Austin, is Vince Hannemann’s towering Cathedral of Junk.
Some 60 tons of discarded items, many of them bicycles, make up the skeleton and decoration of the structure. The construction of the Cathedral started in 1989, when Hannemann was in his 20s. For a few years he collected junk for his project, but it was soon unnecessary as people began to supply him with their unwanted goods.
Still a work in progress, the Cathedral of Junk is evolving. There once stood a three-story tower in the back of the Cathedral, but Hannemann tore it down thinking he was finally done with his long-lasting project. But instead of dismantling the Cathedral further, and after having had a change of heart, he added three more rooms to the structure with the pieces of the former tower.
Seemingly hidden from the front of the house, the Cathedral is not completely invisible to neighbors. Tenants of a townhome complex located behind the house have filed complaints with the city, which in turn warranted inspection by officials. Several city engineers attempted to find weak-points in the structure, though it was found to be structurally sound and safe. Hannemann did have to destroy his pyramid of televisions, but many of these found a new home in the “zen garden of TVs”.
The Cathedral of Junk is open often, however you must call ahead to make an appointment (512-299-7413) or you might end up stuck on the chair of despair. Vince asks for $5 donation per adult. The Cathedral can even be rented for parties, weddings, birthday parties, etc. In fact, in keeping with its name, some couples have even been wed at this Cathedral."	A unique structure in suburban Austin comprised entirely of other people's castaways.
