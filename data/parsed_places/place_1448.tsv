PEZ Visitor Center	"['sweets', 'food museums', 'candy', ""world's largest"", 'museums and collections', 'museums']"	335	643	"Wandering around the enormous PEZ Visitor Center is like falling into a world overrun by the small, sugary bricks and their charismatic dispensers. The roughly 4,000-square-foot space is stuffed with anything and everything related to the classic candy.
Thousands of PEZ dispensers stand on public display, so you can scour the collection to look for familiar characters and more unusual novelty ones. A scavenger hunt rewards keen-eyed visitors with a PEZ-themed prize.
While wandering around, you can spot a PEZ-themed motorcycle, the world’s largest PEZ dispenser, and vintage posters and trinkets that act like a timeline of PEZ history and evolution. The collection also offers more than a visual feast. You can indulge your taste buds and sample the many different candy flavors, including the original peppermint (the company’s name derives from the word “pfefferminzm,” the German word for “peppermint”).
The admission ticket includes a credit toward gift shop purchases and a nifty little PEZ lanyard. You can’t actually tour the manufacturing facility, but you can peep through the visitor center windows to catch a glimpse of the candy making in action."	The world's largest public collection of PEZ memorabilia.
