Currituck Beach Lighthouse	['lighthouses', 'beaches', 'architectural oddities', 'architecture']	768	608	"The Outer Banks are well-known for their black-and-white striped lighthouses at Bodie Island and Hatteras, but in Corolla stands the red-bricked, gothic-inspired Currituck Beach Lighthouse.
The beacon employs a Fresnel lens with a signature interval of 3 seconds on and 17 seconds off.  Unlike its neighbor lights which are operated by the National Park Service, the Currituck lighthouse is privately-funded and operated.
One can climb the 214 stairs (~150 feet) inside the shaft to reach the observation deck just below the lens room.  Tours are self-guided and include wall-mounted exhibits describing the history and science of the lighthouse along the steps.  The 360-degree view from the top includes sights in Currituck Heritage Park, Corolla Village, Currituck Sound, and the Outer Banks toward Duck and Southern Shores."	Beautiful Gothic-inspired lighthouse stands out among the run-of-the-mill striped fare on Bodies Island.
