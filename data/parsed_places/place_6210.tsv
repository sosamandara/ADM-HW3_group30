Bulk Candy Store Museum	['food museums', 'candy', 'film', 'collections', 'museums']	154	725	"In the back of a West Palm Beach candy store lies a shrine to sweetness filled with art and memorabilia. The store’s crown jewel: a golden ticket and Everlasting Gobstopper from Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory. Glistening behind glass, the gilded slip has been signed by the cast of the 1971 hit.
The sweet pieces of movie history are part of the collection at Bulk Candy Store. In addition to the movie memorabilia, the walls at the store’s adjacent candy museum are adorned with vintage wrappers and a wide array of giant Pez dispensers. The six rooms offer a brief look at the history of humanity satisfying its sweet tooth, from cultivating honey in ancient Egypt to the modern production of candies today.
You don’t need a golden ticket to gain entrance to this homage to treats, but the guided tour costs $13 for adults and $9 for kids. If the tour’s samples aren’t sufficient, the store itself offers plenty of modern and vintage candies, ranging from Sugar Daddies and Whirly Pops to Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups and M&Ms."	"This shop also boasts some sweet memorabilia from ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory."""
