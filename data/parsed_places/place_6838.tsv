Lullaby Factory	['hospitals', 'sounds', 'music', 'art']	265	1798	"Between a new and old building at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London is a secret music machine. 
The Lullaby Factory was installed in 2012 and is a concoction of pipes and horns that covers one of the hospital’s old brick buildings. It’s lodged in a courtyard that was created when a new glass building was constructed next door. The older hospital is slated to be torn down in 2028, but Studio Weave designed this hidden sound installation to add discovery and joy for the young patients at the hospital.
You can listen to the music created by sound artist Jessica Curry beneath different towering metal devices, some components of which were salvaged from an old hospital boiler. For those children who are unable to leave their hospital rooms, the music from the Lullaby Factory is available to be piped in through radios."	Wedged between two buildings at the Great Ormond Street Hospital is this secret music installation.
