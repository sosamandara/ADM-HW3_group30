Christmas House	['santa claus', 'outsider architecture', 'architectural oddities', 'architecture']	148	408	"There is much speculation as to the “real location” of Santa’s workshop, but there is a strong case for northern Iceland, 7km from the city of Akureyri. The isolated location means minimal distractions for Santa and his crew, and the weather is certainly cold enough to accommodate his reindeer.
What really distinguishes this Santa’s workshop from others is its owner, who is a little too convincing as the big man in the red suit. Even upon visiting in June, one will be greeted with festive cheer. Here Santa lives in the workshop, which only adds authenticity to his claim. As you might imagine, the Christmas theme only gets stronger once inside the workshop, and although there are some items for sale, this is clearly a labour of love more than a commercial enterprise.
The perfect place to have a Merry Christmas, you can top off your experience by posting a letter home from Santa’s mailbox."	Iceland: home to volcanoes, waterfalls and, apparently, Santa?
