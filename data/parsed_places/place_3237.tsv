Laburnum Arch	['botanical tunnels', 'botanical gardens', 'flowers', 'flora', 'tunnels', 'subterranean sites', 'trees', 'plants']	123	829	"Every spring, this mesmerizing flower arch blooms within a Welsh botanic garden. Golden flowers burst from the branches of the laburnum tree, draping downward to creating a tunnel capped by a lush ceiling of blossoms.
The breathtaking 180-foot-long archway is said to be the longest in the United Kingdom. It was planned by Henry Davis Pochin, the man who created the Bodnant Garden in 1875, and has been enchanting those who pass beneath the ceiling of dangling flowers ever since.
The delicate blossoms are a welcome pop of color to counteract Wales’ often wet, dreary weather. When the tree blooms, its flowers cascade down from the branches like delicate pearls, earning them the nickname “Golden Rain.” Its fallen petals pepper the floor to create a walkway dotted with bright, sunshine-colored spots.
The Laburnum Arch is a fleeting phenomenon. It only lasts for a few weeks, usually in late May or early June. Predicting when exactly the archway will bloom is tricky, as the tree can be a bit finicky depending on the mildness of the winter. But even when not in bloom, the tree’s verdant leaves still create an enticing botanic tunnel. Walking beneath the thick mass of greenery feels like wandering within a fairytale forest."	A breathtaking flower tunnel bursts with beautiful golden blossoms.
