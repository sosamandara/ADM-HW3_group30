H.R. Giger Museum	['science fiction', 'museums and collections', 'art', 'museums']	448	1232	"In the quaint medieval city of Gruyères, Switzerland, you may meander the cobblestone streets, visit a 13th Century Chateau and take in the stunning valley panoramas from the historic rampart walls. But a far more fascinating site here contrasts with the Swiss scenery and piques the modern curiosity. Along the way to the fromagerie is the H.R. Giger Museum.
Even if the name H. R. Giger doesn’t mean anything to you, chances are you are familiar with his best known creation. H. R. Giger is the mind behind the titular monsters from the Alien movie franchise, among many other works frightening works of art. Swiss-born, Giger fell in love with the village at an exhibition there in the 1990s, and now the town’s medieval walls house his museum dedicated to his art, it contains the world’s largest collection of his works.
The Museum’s interior was designed entirely by Giger himself. The Museum is intentionally dark, grim, and slightly disturbing: stepping inside feels like entering an alien’s lair. His oeuvre is available for view, including paintings, drawings, even furniture. The disparity between bucolic Switzerland and the obsessive, bizarre works of Giger will lend a Surreal tint to a day spent in Gruyères.
While you’re in the area, be sure to visit the Museum’s HR Giger Bar open 10:00-8:30 daily, opposite the museum. The ceiling is like the inside of a ribcage, with vertebrae twisting along its vaulted ceiling.
A beautiful panoramic photograph of the museum can be seen at the museum’s website."	The bizarre visions of H.R. Giger, tucked away in a Swiss medieval city.
