LaBeL RéCuP'	['jewelry', 'recycling', 'fashion', 'shops', 'art']	108	965	"This hidden gem is filled with artsy, upcycled creations like chairs, handbags, jewelry, rugs, lamps, and even musical instruments. Beer bottle caps, candy wrappers, plastic bags, soda can tabs, drink cartons, and glass wine bottles are just some of the materials used to create the unique works in the Paris boutique. 
The pieces were all handcrafted in various countries across the globe and repurposed into intriguing items that are displayed throughout the store and available for purchase. It’s an eclectic blend of art, fashion, and sustainable creation.
The artisans who make these unique goods pride themselves on finding ways to reduce waste by designing and constructing uncommon pieces out of things that most people would typically throw away. Most of the stuff within the store is high quality and one-of-a-kind, so it would be extremely rare to see anything similar at the local mall or shopping center.
This tiny boutique could easily be missed, as it is tucked away on a quiet street. It’s definitely worth taking a detour to visit and is only a short walk from the Oberkampf metro station. While the store does have some items available to purchase online, it’s much more fascinating to visit in person and see all the upcycled goods up close."	An off-the-beaten-path boutique stuffed with an eclectic collection of upcycled goods.
