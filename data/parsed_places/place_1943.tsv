Keith Haring Mural	['murals', 'outsider art']	139	468	"This 40-foot tall mural was painted by pop-artist Keith Haring in 1986. It was his gift to the city while visiting for an art exhibition at the Stedelijk Museum.
The mural is the largest Haring painting created in Europe. It adorned an outdoor wall at the museum’s former storage facility until the museum moved locations in 1989. The building was subsequently converted into a cold-storage facility and the mural was concealed by industrial boarding for almost 30 years.
Haring’s gift to Amsterdam would have remained hidden until Dutch graffiti artist, Mick La Rock, came across a photo that featured the mural and launched a campaign to discover its whereabouts."	This massive mural by famed pop-artist Keith Haring was hidden for almost 30 years until its 2018 rediscovery.
