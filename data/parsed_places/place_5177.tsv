Scoops Ice Cream & Such	['ice cream', 'sculpture gardens', 'sculptures', 'art']	123	587	"At first glance, this ice cream shop run out of a camper van seems to be merely a charming stop in the woods of Mount Airy. But those who venture farther into the forest behind the van will find a delightful surprise: a sculpture garden.
The forest path is lined with metal artwork created by Chazz Elstone, the shop’s owner and an artist who’s had pieces displayed in downtown Mount Airy. This secluded site features a range of sculptures, including a Biblically-themed section showcasing a joyously dancing King David and a “forest chapel” with a pulpit and cross. There’s also a treehouse on the path, where guests can leave Post-It notes offering encouraging thoughts on the windows and walls.
Order an ice-cream cone and savor your treat as you wander through this unique gallery in a serene natural setting."	Follow the path behind this treat-slinging camper van to a sculpture garden in the forest.
