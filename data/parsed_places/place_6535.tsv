Trompenburg Arboretum	['gardens', 'plants', 'nature']	66	456	"On the edge of Rotterdamâ€™s city center lies a well-hidden green secret: Trompenburg Gardens and Arboretum. Trompenburg has been a public park since 1958 and holds more than 4,000 unique trees and plants. Visitors will also find wildlife in the park, like bees and butterflies, birds, and turtles. The park is well-kept and beautiful all year round.
In the middle of the garden lies a greenhouse, a true Valhalla for cactus and succulent lovers. One of the paths will lead you to a cute teahouse, where you can sit down with a nice cup of tea or coffee and enjoy one of their delicious muffins before you continue your green adventure."
