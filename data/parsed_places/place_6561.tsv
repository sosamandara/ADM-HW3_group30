Billy's Antiques and Props	['purveyors of curiosities']	70	479	Enter and youâ€™ll find the eponymous store owner, Billy Leroy. Look for the tall dapper figure of a man with a long, light-brown ponytail, tattoos peeking out from his elegant custom-made shirt. Lurking in every corner and hanging from the ceiling of the tent are demons and gargoyles, Jesus with a bloodied crown of thorns, stuffed foxes and other fauna in a tableau of fabulously secondhand treasures from everywhere.	A veritable variety of odds and ends.
