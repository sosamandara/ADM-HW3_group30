Dr. Seuss Museum	['color', 'books', 'literature', 'museums']	363	1188	"The name Theodor Geisel might not ring a bell, but Dr. Seuss certainly will. Under this pen name, the beloved children’s writer produced some of literature’s most memorable characters, like the Grinch, the Cat in the Hat, and the Lorax.
Geisel was born in Springfield, Massachusetts and his first children’s book, And To Think That I Saw It On Mulberry Street, was published in 1937 (after being rejected by several publishers), launching a career that spanned several decades. His language was simple, and the bright illustrations captured the fancy of children. Many of his works remain staples for parents, introducing their kids to reading. 
In June 2017, the city of Springfield opened a museum dedicated to its most creative resident and the colorful universe of his books. The initial rooms explore the writer’s connection to the city, especially during his childhood years. The facade of his home at 74 Fairfield Street is on display, a replica of the bakery, factory, and (perhaps unsurprisingly) zoo that managed by different members of Geisel’s family when he was growing up.
In Readingville, the interactive exhibits are all based on different characters and events in Dr Seuss books, and aim to invite kids into his world and discover the joy of reading. The second story showcases items from Geisel’s studio and home, including some of his artwork and furniture, giving visitors a sense of the life and living space of Dr. Seuss."	A museum dedicated to the quirky and colorful world created by Springfield's favorite son.
