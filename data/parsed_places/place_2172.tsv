National Academy of Sciences	['science museums']	170	418	"Many people love the Einstein Memorial on the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) grounds, but few know they can go inside the actual building. 
The NAS features 1924 art and architecture celebrating the history and significance of science. Architect, Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue designed the building in collaboration with architectural sculptor Lee Lawrie (famous for the Atlas at Rockefeller Center in NYC) and muralist Hildreth Meiere. Meiere’s career got a mega jumpstart as a result of the project. The NAS also maintains rotating art exhibits, as well as a permanent collection that explores the various themes of science and culture."	For 60 years, the academy had no permanent location until members voted Washington D.C. as its forever home.
