Boulder Teahouse	['restaurants', 'architecture']	964	1182	"This beautifully hand-crafted teahouse located in Boulder, Colorado was given to the American city by the mayor and citizens of Dushanbe, Tajikstan in an ambitious sister cities program.
In the program, Boulder and Dushanbe agreed to exchange one building each, and in exchange for the incredible tea house, Dushanbe received an internet cafe. Unfortunately, after the teahouse was constructed in Tajikstan and sent to the United States to be assembled, it sat in storage for eight years before being erected. In addition, the effort to give the internet cafe to the city of Dushanbe didn’t even commence until 16 years later, and wasn’t nearly as beautifully crafted or culturally significant as the teahouse they had sent to Boulder."	This tea house was a hand-built gift from Boulder's sister city in Tajikstan.
