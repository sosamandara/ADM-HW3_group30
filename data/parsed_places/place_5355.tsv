David Bowie's Childhood Home	['eccentric homes', 'music', 'homes']	170	817	"While he would grow into the Ziggy Stardust, the Thin White Duke, Aladdin Sane, and other unforgettable personas, David Bowie’s life began in a humble flat in Brixton, and while there is nothing on the site commemorate our late alien’s time in the home, it can still be seen from the outside.  
Bowie’s childhood home is located at 40 Stansfield Road in a quaint Brixton, London neighborhood. This is where parents John and Peggy raised David Robert Jones (stage name: David Bowie) until he was six years old. Bowie passed away on January 10, 2016 at the age of 69, and now that he has left the Earth, the place he began has taken on all new importance.
The road the home is located on is lined with three-story brick homes with white trim, trees, and hedges. Get on Google Earth and you can wander the neighborhood that Bowie wandered as a wee lad and only child before the family moved to Bromley, Kent. His mother worked as a waitress and his father as a promotions officer. Some folks still come by and take pictures, but the current owners say it has yet to become a place of pilgrimage.
The home was purchased in 2000 for £275,000 and as of 2013 was worth around £600,000. The owner of the building doesn’t seem to be too impressed in its famous heritage, so the likelihood of the building becoming a famous rock and roll museum seems pretty slim, but maybe if interest in the late musician’s childhood grows it can earn a plaque or something."	The childhood home of Earth's alien chameleon is a humble Brixton flat.
