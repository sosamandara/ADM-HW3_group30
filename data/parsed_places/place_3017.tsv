Bernheim Forest Giants	['recycling', 'woodwork', 'sculptures']	317	760	"To celebrate the 90th anniversary of the Bernheim Arboretum and Research Forest, Danish artist Thomas Dambo constructed three giants to commemorate the occasion. The massive sculptures were created using wood and a variety of other sustainable materials. The giants can be found along a two-mile loop trail encompassing the arboretum. Visitors are allowed to take pictures, touch, and decorate the giants.Â 
The sculptures were created as a family and each has its own unique name; they are, Mama Loumari, Little Nis, and Little Elina. The father of the little giants, Isak Heartstone, can be found along the Trollstigen Trail in Breckenridge, Colorado. The giants even have their own fairytale called, The Great Story of the Little People and the Giant Trolls: While the Weather got Better."	Visitors to this arboretum are greeted by three smiling giants crafted from sustainable materials.
