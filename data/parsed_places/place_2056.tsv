Legends Books, Antiques & Soda Fountain has transformed part of the old mine shafts and underground tunnels snaking beneath the surface of Sonora, California. What was once a general store and bank is now a lively cafe and soda shop with a quaint bookstore tucked below.
Grab a coffee or ice cream float from the cafe upstairs—be sure to take notice of its gorgeous mahogany and brass bar—then head down into the old gold mine shaft below. There, you can browse through the shelves of books lining the walls. You’ll spot copious hardback books, as well as rare and out-of-print finds.
The subterranean space offers a winding glimpse into the area’s gold mining past. The tiny reading area is nestled against the mine’s original rock walls. In some parts, you can even sneak a peek of the old mine shaft itself."	A cozy bookstore is tucked within an old gold mine shaft beneath the cafe and ice cream shop.
