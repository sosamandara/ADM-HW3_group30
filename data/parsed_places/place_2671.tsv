Georgiana Cemetery	['ghost stories', 'murder', 'haunted', 'graves', 'gravestones', 'cemeteries']	142	687	"Georgiana Cemetery, also known as Crooked Mile Cemetery, is one of the oldest graveyards in Brevard County, Florida. It is quaint and beautiful, with many tall trees adorned with Spanish moss, which blows eerily in the wind coming in off the water. 
While interesting because of its age, history, and beauty, the Georgiana Cemetery may be best known as the burial place of a local murder victim and supposed ghost, Ethel Allen. Allen was just 19 years old when she was found murdered and mutilated on the banks of the Indian River Lagoon in the early 1900s. Nearly a century later, her murder is still unsolved, though there was a potential suspect who was never found.
Perhaps due to the grisly circumstances surrounding Allen’s death, and the general eerie atmosphere of the old cemetery, there have been many reports of ghost sightings and the feeling of spirits in the area. Some believe that Allen’s ghost haunts the cemetery where she is interred. Adding to the curiosity, the headstone of Allen’s grave is handmade, making it unique among the other graves in the cemetery. To this day, her gravesite is regularly decorated by unknown benefactors."	Believed to be haunted, this old cemetery is beautifully adorned with Spanish moss hanging from the trees.
