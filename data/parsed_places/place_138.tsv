24-Hour-Sprinkles	['Unique Restaurants & Bars', 'shops']	433	1044	"In what could quite possibly be the most frivolous yet exciting advancement in the competitive cupcake industry, the chain bakery “Sprinkles’ has made its power move: 24-hour cupcake dispensers, or Cupcake ATMs.
Every day, 600 freshly baked cupcakes are waiting behind a facade that works much like the ATM cash machines we are already accustomed to. Anytime, day or night, you can insert your credit card, make a selection from the rotating flavor descriptions, and for $4.00 a piece, purchase that emergency snack cake you so desperately needed. You can then watch on the display as a robotic arm retrieves your treat and delivers it through the cupcake chute located directly beneath the screen.
It seems unfair that the privileged residents of Beverly Hills (and their pooches, the machines dispense doggie treats as well) are the only ones receiving this remarkable technology. Fear not, for the cupcake ATM is coming to New York City in the summer of 2012, and Sprinkles has been taking suggestions for other locations.
Besides its current 10 stores, they have implied they would like to place cupcake ATMs in towns and on streets that are nowhere near a Sprinkles store, ensuring equal and just cupcake dispersal to all, and are taking suggestions."	Ingenious bakery opens up the first Cupcake ATM at their flagship location in Beverly Hills.
