Grannie's Cookie Jars & Ice Cream Parlor	['food markets and stores', 'ice cream', 'collections']	171	478	"To get to the ice cream counter at this small shop, you have to walk through the largest collection of cookie jars in the world. The more than 2,600 cookie containers at Grannie’s Cookie Jars & Ice Cream Parlor are part of a collection that Edith Eva Fuchs has been amassing since 1988.
Customers can peruse the shelves of jars shaped like everything from Bugs Bunny and Wonder Woman to fruit baskets, cows, and the Titanic as they enjoy ice cream in homemade waffle cones (each of which has a Hershey’s Kiss waiting at the bottom). If there was a favorite jar from your childhood you just may see it here. As for Fuchs? She told the Guinness Book of World Records that her favorite is a jar shaped like Roy Rogers riding his horse, Trigger."	More than 3,200 cookie jars line the walls and shelves of this little shop and over 1,000 salt and pepper shakers	['/places/courthouse-tree', '/places/bilby-tower', '/places/weapons-to-wetlands-fernald-preserve']	10107 Columbia Stree; Metamora, Indiana; United States	39.4477	-85.1332	/users/k344y	2019-10-28 00:00:00	['/lists/unique-ice-cream-shops']	['/places/pizza-brain-museum-of-pizza-culture', '/places/coppelia', '/places/hurleston-farm-giant-straw-sculptures', '/places/disney-collection-orlando-public-library']	/places/grannies-cookie-jars-ice-cream-parlor
