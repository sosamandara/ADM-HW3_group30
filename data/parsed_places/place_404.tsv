Founded in 1975, the park is named for the mythical three-headed white elephant which the uppermost of the falls is said to resemble. In addition to the waterfalls the park is also home to a series of caves known as Mi, Rua, Wang Bahdan, and Phartat. Visitors can hike along the seven waterfalls and swim in theirÂ pools."
