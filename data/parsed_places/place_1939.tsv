Center of the World, Ohio	['roadside attractions', 'monuments']	239	637	"In an attempt to create a major economic center from scratch, mad investor Randall Wilmot founded Center of the World, Ohio on a big name and not much else.
Thinking that he could start a community that would then grow with railroad traffic, Wilmot was disappointed when the railroad companies chose nearby Warren, Ohio for their hub. Wilmot quickly moved on, but Center of the World managed to survive as a community. Today the small area doesn’t contain much more than a few houses and retail spaces, but the main attraction is the road sign stating the community’s name. A popular photo subject, the sign has actually been stolen and replaced a number of times as it is the sole tourist attraction in the area. Despite the town’s small size, it’s hard to feel insignificant standing at the Center of the World."	A grandiose title could not save this mercantile community from obscurity.
