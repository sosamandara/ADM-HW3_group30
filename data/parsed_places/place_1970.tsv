Back to the 80s Cafe	['nostalgia', 'diner', 'pop culture', 'Unique Restaurants & Bars', 'collections']	57	412	"Back to the 80s Cafe is a shrine to popular culture, plastered in posters, tapes, and records of nostalgic favorites.
With an arcade, great diner food, a TV looping classic MTV music videos, and plenty of memorabilia on sale, Back to the 80s Cafe is a kitschy dreamland. The refrigerator is stocked with throwbacks such as Jolt Cola and Tab, which pair nicely with Tetris-shaped tater tots. You can order imaginative shakes such as the cinnamon-swirl “Madonna” or the “Urkel” (which adds Nerds candies to cotton candy ice cream), then head back to the arcade for a round of Pac-Man, Galaga, Donkey Kong, or Ghostbusters pinball. You’ll find Pee-wee Herman trading cards, movie posters, two-dollar vinyl records, and more.
The restaurant hosts frequent karaoke and trivia nights. There’s a great atmosphere inside, and no detail is spared when there is a chance to reference New Wave stars or cult films."	This diner's a kitschy dreamland for anyone whose heart is stuck in the 1980s.
