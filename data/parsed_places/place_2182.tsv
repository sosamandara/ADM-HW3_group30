Metropolitan Waterworks Museum	['waterworks', 'retro-tech', 'museums and collections', 'museums']	286	920	"The Metropolitan Waterworks Museum is located at the original Chestnut Hill Reservoir and pumping station. Built in 1887, it pumped the water for Boston until the supply source was shifted to the Quabbin Reservoir in the 1970s.
It was left to disrepair and treasure hunters until the Friends of the Waterworks began advocating for its preservation in 1991, and in 2005 Massachusetts passed legislation allowing the sale of the site for re-development with preservation restrictions.
Containing amazing architecture and remarkable machines, the museum consists of the Great Engines Hall which houses three historic steam-powered pumping engines."	Beautiful steampunk ghosts of early Massachusetts.
