Texas Falls	['waterfalls', 'water']	121	653	"Driving east on VT 125 through the Middlebury Gap, about three miles before you hit VT 100, on the left is a small turn-off leading you to the Texas Falls. This hidden geological wonder is certainly worth the visit. The falls were formed 12,000 years ago when the last glaciers retreated from the Green Mountains, leaving a rushing river that carved out potholes and gorges. 
A few decades ago, the pools around the waterfall were a favorite haunt for swimmers, however, swimming is now prohibited due to the dangerous currents. As you gaze out at the rushing water, think of how the Hancock Branch drains east into the White River, which drains south into the Connecticut River, which drains into the Long Island Sound, the Atlantic Ocean, and all the seven seas."	An ancient glacial pothole waterfall in the heart of the Green Mountains.
