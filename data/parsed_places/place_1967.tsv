Midland City Station	['railroads']	87	439	"Constructed as early as the late 19th century, the Midland City Station was once one of many stops that dotted the route connecting the Columbus and Chillicothe branches of the famed B&O Railroad. The ticket both and boarding platform are just some of the features that remain from a time when travelers would arrive and depart the then prosperous town of Midland. Now sitting in disrepair, the community has discussed various plans to renovate the building, none of which have came to fruition.
Though technically a no trespassing zone, the community doesnâ€™t seem too particular about the occasional explorer. The building is relatively stable, though caution is advised when exploring the 2nd floor. Be sure to not to miss the maintenance room accessible around the back of the building, as it contains various repair parts and tools left when the station was decommissioned."	Now in disrepair, this 19th century station was a stop on of the famed B&O Railroad.
