Freddi Arcade & Toys is packed with vintage games from the 1980s and ’90s. It’s an ideal spot to relive (or experience for the first time) the glory of classic video games.
Freddi Arcade has some of the most memorable names in games including Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, Mortal Kombat, and Street Fighter, as well as classic pinball machines like Fun House, Dirty Harry and Terminator 2.
You can take part in “all-you-can-play” for one hour for a flat fee, or if you’re looking for something more intimate, there are console rooms for rent where you can choose the console that suits you best: NES, Nintendo 64, Nintendo Gamecube, Sega Mega Drive and Playstation 4.
Update September 2018: The store is closed."	A vintage video game wonderland in downtown Reykjavik.
