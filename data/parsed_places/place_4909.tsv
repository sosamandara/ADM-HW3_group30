Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard	['graveyards', 'cemeteries', 'food']	1384	1190	"Ben & Jerry might be a couple of ice cream tycoons, but they’ve remained true to their roots. Case in point: the deliciously somber Flavor Graveyard located on the grounds of their factory in Waterbury, Vermont.
Opened in 1997, the memorial to bygone flavors was originally an online-only affair, until a handful of resin headstones were mocked up and planted on a hill behind the factory. Like a pet cemetery for punny ice cream recipes, each grave marker was given a clever epitaph that summed up the life and death of the flavor. Dearly de-pinted flavors (Ben & Jerry’s term) include fan favorites like Turtle Soup, Fossil Fuel, and of course, Wavy Gravy. Some of the flavors ended up in the ground due to bad sales, while others met stranger fates. Each of the headstones also bears the birth and death dates of the flavors. 
According to their site, there are 34 flavors interred in the Ben & Jerry’s boneyard. Visitors can either take a factory tour which includes a visit to the cemetery, or they can come and pay their respects individually. Luckily, sometimes flavors are resurrected."	The sweetest graveyard in the world is filled with headstones for dearly de-pinted ice cream flavors.
