Old Beacon Hat Mill	['factories', 'abandoned', 'ruins']	151	515	"Since it was established in 1879, this old mill has been repurposed over the past century to suit the ever-changing industries of Beacon, New York. It has changed many hands throughout its lifetime.
Some of the last companies that operated here were The Merrimac Hat Company, which sold the property in 1949. After that, Beacon Terminals Corporation owned the property and it was used as a warehouse. In the 90s, the property was acquired by real estate developer William S. Ehrlich and has been in increasing states of ruin ever since."	A 19th century hat factory still stands as a crumbling ruin in upstate New York.
