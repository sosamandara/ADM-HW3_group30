Bart Prince Residence and Studio	['houses', 'homes', 'architectural oddities', 'architecture']	275	488	"Located at a quiet street corner in the stylish Nob Hill neighborhood of Albuquerque is the residence and professional studio of architect Bart Prince. The home was completed in 1984, with the conical library tower addition completed in 1990 and the gallery added in 2006. The structure is also often referred to as either the “Spaceship House” or the “Bug House.”
Prince was born in New Mexico and graduated from Arizona State University. He opened his first office in 1973 and is well-known for his unique and organic residential projects across the American Southwest and elsewhere. He was also an Associate Architect with Bruce Goff  on the design of the Pavilion for Japanese Art at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.
According to his biography in Architectural Digest, Prince prefers designs, “that have an idea involved in their creation. The building tells you that immediately—you are enticed, wanting to know more.” Anyone who has seen his residence and studio in Albuquerque would love to learn more about its unique design, its interior spaces, as well as the person who created it. Unfortunately, the structure is not open to the public, but you can sure admire the house and studio from the street or from the public sidewalk."	"It's easy to see why this eclectic architectural wonder has been dubbed the ""Spaceship House."""
