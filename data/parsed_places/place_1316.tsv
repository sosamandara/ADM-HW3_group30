Montgomery Bell Tunnel	['tunnels', 'subterranean sites', 'caves', 'ecosystems', 'water']	247	964	"Carved out of the natural limestone using gunpowder and slave labor, the Montgomery Tunnel was the United States’ first successful water diversion tunnel.
Also known as the “Patterson Forge Tunnel” this waterway was built in the early 19th century to take advantage of the drop in river elevations in a bend in the Harpeth River, to operate an iron forge.  It was blasted out of the limestone using black powder and slave labor, and is now a straight cut through the earth.  This bend in the river is a popular day hiking and canoeing destination. The tunnel is large enough that there was a recent fire that started within the tunnel that grew large enough to destabilize the cave and the road overhead.
Montgomery Bell Tunnel was designated a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1981.
Update: As of 2017, parts of the inside of the tunnel have collapsed and it is no longer possible to walk through. While it is still accessible to view via the hiking trails, the swimming area below the falls now has No Swimming signs posted and the tunnel itself has a sign reading “hazardous, keep out”."	The first full-scale tunnel built in America is short but scenic.
