The Georgetown Trailer Park Mall	['malls', 'shops']	288	963	"The Georgetown Trailer Park Mall (born in 2010) is a quintessential Seattle landmark home to designers, artists, and collectors running independent shops out of vintage trailers. 
What can you expect to find? Custom aquariums and planters, handmade balms and potions, vintage clothing and home decor. Locally made jewelry, ceramics, original artwork, literary curiosities, and vinyl records are just a few of the many treasures hiding in these unique storefronts.  Satisfy your sweet tooth and grab a baker’s dozen of Lowrider Baking Company cookies. Meet a femme/queer powered art gang and take a selfie with E.T. Grab a blind date with a book, pay your respects to Jack Parsons, and challenge a friend to a hula hoop contest.
Georgetown feels a bit isolated from the rest of the city. It’s its own little industrial world, surrounded by huge trucks, trains, and highways. The Georgetown Trailer Park Mall lies in Boeing Field’s flight path, so expect to see (and most definitely hear) the rush of aircraft flying over. Between junkyards and art studios and breweries you’ll find a record store (Georgetown Records), a graphic novel shop (Fantagraphics Bookstore And Gallery), a pin ball and video game arcade (Flip Flip Ding Ding), and a handful of bars all within a few blocks of the Trailer Park. Plan on spending the day in this unique and historic part of town.
Fun fact: Ed Sheeran’s “Shape of You” music video was filmed on location in Georgetown. The video shows Sheeran with dancer and model Jennie Pegouskie leaving All City Coffee. The two take a taxi up Airport Way and head toward The Trailer Park Mall."	This offbeat trailer park is home to vintage peddlers, local artists, indie makers, and more.
