The Space Museum	['strange science']	83	443	"Paying homage to man’s greatest adventure the Space Museum takes visitors on a journey through the history of space exploration. The Space Museum in Bonne Terre, Missouri houses Scott Carpenter’s flight manual, lunar dust on an Apollo collection bag, and the flag flown on the first space shuttle mission.
If those artifacts don’t satiate your curiosity for the great beyond you can also try on a cosmonaut’s glove, touch a shuttle tile, and study a meteorite to get some hands on experience. The museum’s mission is to inspire the next generation of space explorers and inspire them to think about the future.
This was one of the sites that participated in Obscura Day on April 28th, 2012. Click here to view the event listing."	A museum dedicated to man's boldest venture.
