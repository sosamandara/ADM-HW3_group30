Witches Gulch	['cliffs', 'rock formations', 'geology']	173	482	"Nowadays when people think Wisconsin Dells, they probably think water parks. However, this part of southern Wisconsin is home to a number of beautiful sandstone cliffs. One particular slot canyon, known as the Witches Gulch, is almost otherworldly.
The sandstone in this area formed millions of years ago, back when this region was the bed of an ancient lake. As the landscape changed over time, the lake bed was exposed to the elements. Wind and water carved out a meandering path through the sandstone that today takes the form of a deep valley. 
A trail winds through the canyon, packed with beautiful mossy sites and narrow passageways. This is a short little hike that will leave you in awe of nature’s beauty. This stop is only accessible via the Upper Dells Boat Tours."	Over thousands of years, this slot canyon was carved out of the bed of an ancient lake.
