Museum of Fond Memories at Reed Books	['bookstores', 'books', 'literature', 'museums and collections']	189	686	"When Jim Reed’s growing collection of books and random objects started taking over his family’s house, he knew there was only one thing to do. He set up a bookstore, in 1980. 
Reed Books is a rare and unusual book store, also housing the “Museum of Fond Memories.” This unique shop contains books as old as 500 years and more contemporary books. The museum allows visitors to examine and purchase the antiquarian objects, including some rare volumes most shops no longer carry.
Reed began adding to his already extensive collection of literature and the result was a cozy book loft with old and new books battling for shelf space. The tenor of the store is nostalgia; Reed has great memories of growing up surrounded by books and the bookstore is an attempt to create such an atmosphere for visitors. The shop’s “museum” is an assortment of stickers, toys, albums, trinkets, posters, and other objects “you wish your mother had not thrown away.” The collection is eclectic, but Jim Reed knows where everything is."	A unique book shop with a collection of rare tomes and a nostalgia museum.
