Galco's Soda Pop Stop	['purveyors of curiosities']	932	3112	"In the age of globalization, when the long tentacles of Pepsi and Coca-Cola have touched even the most remote places in the world, Galco’s Soda Pop Stop is a unique place.
It is a throwback to the age when every county had its own small soda manufacturer and every town its own beer brewery. This shop carries an immense variety of soda brands from all corners of the U.S., and as far away as Romania. Its catalog includes obscure, almost forgotten, old brands and imports available in only a few spots on the planet. Find flavors as strange as rose water and cucumber soda.
The true treasure of this place is its owner, John F. Nese, a man who may be the world’s preeminent expert on matters of soda flavors. He can authoritatively explain why glass bottles are better than plastic ones and why Kosher for Passover Coca-Cola are superior to the normal variety. He stands always ready to suggest a new variety or flavor.
Galco’s Soda Pop Stop offers online purchases with limited international delivery."	Shop selling 500 flavors of soda has something for everyone.
