"""Ju-On: The Grudge"" House"	['film locations', 'film', 'houses', 'homes']	24	416	"This infamous house made famous by director Takashi Shimizu was used for all the movies in the series including Ju-On: The Grudge, it’s sequels and American remakes. 
It is currently abandoned (possibly still owned by Shimizu or the film studio) and you are not allowed to be on the property. It’s still worth a visit if you are a horror film buff or just curious because you can still get rather close to the house."	An infamous house made famous by director Takashi Shimizu.
