Spectacle Island Sea Glass Beaches	['beaches', 'water']	170	888	The giant collection of broken trinkets, dishware, and toys in the visitor’s center is easily surpassed by the amount of neat junk one can find themselves on the beaches of Spectacle Island. The smoothed colored glass and porcelain pieces, the tea cup handles and old shoes - it’s a beach comber’s dream come true. This trash escaped the land fill that makes up most of the mass of the island, before it was capped off and filled in in the 1980s and 90s. The ranger staff requests that beach combers leave their treasures where they’ve found them, or bring them up for display at the visitor’s center - if everyone took their discoveries home, the beaches wouldn’t be quite so neat to look at.	Trash escaped from a landfill to fill beaches with all kinds of treasure.
