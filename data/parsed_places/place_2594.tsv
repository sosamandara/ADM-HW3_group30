Evel Knievel Museum	['motorcycles', 'pop culture', 'museums and collections', 'museums']	130	439	"The Evel Knievel Museum takes you through the thrills and spills of the stuntman’s career. It’s a place where daredevil dreams run wild. The collection is packed with information about the many bold endeavors (and failures) that shot the stuntman to fame.
Throughout the 1960s and ‘70s, Knievel captivated American audiences with his wild antics. He tried to complete jump after jump, soaring over enormous obstacles and often wrecking in the process. The motorcyclist miraculously survived all these fate-testing attempts, though he constantly broke bones and wound up in the hospital.
You can discover the wide variety of things Knievel jumped—from trucks to tanks of sharks to Snake River Canyon—and find out more about the extensive amount of injuries he suffered in the process.
Several of the daredevil’s motorcycles are on display. His iconic red, white, and blue rocket cycle is proudly exhibited for all to admire. You can also see some very battered helmets sitting within glass cases like little testaments to his daring feats. And if that weren’t enough, you can try a virtual jump for yourself.
The museum is on the grounds of Topeka’s Historic Harley Davidson dealership, which also houses a small motorcycle museum."
