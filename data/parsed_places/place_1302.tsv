Niagara Tesla Monument	['nicola tesla', 'monuments', 'statues']	725	448	"In Queen Victoria Park there resides a figure of one of the greatest scientific minds, watching over the waters which were so important to one of his greatest achievements.
While electrical achievements are more often attributed to Ben Franklin and Thomas Edison, Tesla was the man behind alternating current, which allowed electricity to actually become a practical tool of humanity.
One of his larger projects took place at Niagara, though more on the American side of the border. Said to be inspired by the power of Niagara Falls he saw in a photo, he yearned to harness the power the pounding water represented. Eventually this inspiration led to his invention and cooperation in construction of the first AC hydroelectric power plant.
The monument shows Tesla standing with a cane atop on of his AC motors. The sculpture, sponsored by the St. George Serbian Orthodox Church of Niagara, is the winning design of Les Drysdale, from Hamilton, Ontario."	Niagara Falls holds a special place in Nikola Tesla's history, so they put a statue on it.
