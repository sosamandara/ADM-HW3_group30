DEVIL-ish Little Things Museum is a private collection of macabre curiosities in Vancouver, Washington. Marion Held’s massive menagerie of demons is housed in an old church abandoned in the ‘70s and later renovated into a home.
Held’s antique collection is of mostly made up of European novelty objects, statues, jewelry, books, lamps, matchboxes, vases, books, and art related to the devil and his friends. 
A visit to the old church (by appointment only) offers a chance to see and handle some truly unusual objects. The collection is worth a visit for locals—many of whom aren’t even aware of the attraction—and tourists alike."	A whimsical menagerie of devils, krampuses, satyrs, and other horned creatures.
