The 'Home Alone' House	['eccentric homes', 'homes', 'architectural oddities', 'architecture']	381	1002	"For those who grew up in the 90s, Home Alone is a sort of cultural touchstone. One of the most iconic places in the film was Kevin McCallisterâ€™s (Macaulay Culkin) home, a gorgeous mansion located in the Chicago suburb of Winnetka.
Built in the 1920s, the building is comprised of red brick and was built in the colonial Georgian style. As one enters the house, the infamous staircase welcomes guests, while the legendary living room seems to call out for the addition of cardboard cutouts of Michael Jordan. Remember that attic that Kevin slept in? In real life, the attic is actually an attic bedroom with two grand suites and numerous nooks and crannies for storage."	Recognized the world over as the home of the McCallisters in the 1990 movie Home Alone.
