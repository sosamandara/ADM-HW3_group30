Mount Greylock	['state high points', 'war memorial', 'geographic markers']	637	880	"Visitors to the mountain can either drive to the summit via Rockwell or Notch Road from May through October, or hike up on several trails including the Appalachian. 
The mountain is crowned by the 93-foot tall Massachusetts War Memorial Tower. Built in 1932, the beacon at the top is lit at night and is visible from up to 70 miles away. Views from the summit and tower windows extend into the five surrounding states. Also at the summit is the Bascom Lodge, a hotel built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s that host guests seasonally.
Mount Greylock also is, according to J.K. Rowling, the location of the North American wizarding school, Ilvermorny.
J.K. Rowling revealed the name of the school in 2016 to fans on her site Pottermore, as part of a series of a story about the history of wizardry in America. According to the story, it was founded by an Irish witch who came to America on the Mayflower. The school of magic is only viewable to wizards and witches, however — concealed by a powerful spell."	Inspiring Herman Melville and Henry David Thoreau, Mount Greylock in western Massachusetts is the highest point in the state at 3,491 feet above sea level.
