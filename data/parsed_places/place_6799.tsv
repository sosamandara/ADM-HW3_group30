Mill Creek	['oasis', 'trails', 'water']	222	634	In the heat of Moab, just a morning of four-wheeling, mountain biking, or hiking can leave even the most ardent of outdoor explorers extremely hot and in need of cool water. Luckily, there is a spot where you can relax called Mill Creek. Just over a half-mile hike leads you to an oasis, complete with a beautiful waterfall. This area of the trail is very popular among hikers and a great location for bird watching.	A small oasis not far from downtown Moab.
