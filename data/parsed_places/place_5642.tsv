Fisherman's Castle on the Irish Bayou	['castles']	302	559	"Located along the waters of the Irish Bayou of New Orleans, Fisherman’s Castle was made to withstand the most extreme of hurricanes, surviving both Hurricane Katrina and Isaac. Constructed in 1981 by Simon Villemarette for the World’s Fair, the tiny castle is composed of two bedrooms and one and a half baths. It was decorated with medieval decor at one point complete with knights, statues, and swords among other ancient-inspired adornments.
After multiple sales and repairs, the current use for the castle is unclear. Rumors of a bed and breakfast have circulated for years, however, visitors today will only be greeted by private property signs."	This strange, small castle on the bayou has withstood the test of time and weather.
