Ghost Roads of Fallschase	['roads', 'abandoned', 'ruins']	120	575	"Driving along Mahan or Buck Lake Road in east Leon County near Fallschase Village Center, one might notice turn lanes and sidewalks that end as suddenly as they began.  
The sidewalks and turns end abruptly, but in the woods behind the Village Center lie other roads. Complete, though aging, these two-lane roads wind through the live oaks and pines, are flanked by retaining walls and veer off into cul-de-sacs. The ruins of one house remain; abandoned and slated for demolition, it was destroyed by arson in 2010.
The Village Center, home of anchor stores Costco, Walmart, and Bass Pro Shop, began development around 2005. Fallschase, however, was originally intended to be a “premier luxury home” neighborhood. Proposed in the early 1970s, the development faced obstacles from claims of misdeeds, business irregularities, environmental impropriety, foreclosures, and bankruptcies. 
Though commercial development continues, there’s been no information on what is to become of the land that was once slated for residential use. The area is heavily patrolled by the Leon County Sheriff’s Office, and trespassers are being charged."	The haunting remains of a failed housing development can still be found behind the big box stores that were to anchor them.
