Texas Eiffel Tower	['eiffel tower', 'monuments']	459	802	"Cities named Paris outside of France all seem to have the need to measure up to their namesake, and install a replica of the Eiffel Tower, and Paris, Texas is no different. They just put a giant cowboy hat on top of theirs.
Unveiled in 1995, the 60-foot tall replica monument was built by a local iron union, the Boiler Makers Local #902. Another replica of Gustav Eiffel’s Parisian masterwork was unveiled that same year in Paris, Tennessee, standing just about five feet taller than the Texas monument. Since the Texas tower was being billed as the “Second Largest Eiffel Tower in the Second Largest Paris” this was a bit of a problem.
In 1998 an independent group of investors devised a plan to somewhat rectify the discrepancy. Put a cowboy hat on it. Thus a huge metal cowboy hat was installed atop the tower, tipped ever so coolly back to push the ten-foot-diameter brim a bit higher. Of course the whole thing became a forgone issue after the Paris hotel in Las Vegas built their 541 foot imitation.
Even without the height rivalry, the Eiffel Tower in Paris, Texas certainly remains the most American of the remakes. And you can’t take that away from it. Well, unless you remove its hat."	In Paris, Texas they have their own Eiffel Tower, it just has a cowboy hat on it.
