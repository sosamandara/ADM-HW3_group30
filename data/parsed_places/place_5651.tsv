Rosehill Cemetery	['cemeteries']	634	1566	"Founded in 1859, Rosehill is Chicago’s largest cemetery, spanning over 350 acres of land on the North Side of the city. Rosehill is home to beautiful monuments and several ghost stories, although none is more terrifying than the real life clown that was spotted in the cemetery at night by a passerby and caught on video.
Rosehill is a quintessential Victorian cemetery with underlying themes of Victorian iconography: the draped urns, the obelisks, the arches. Unlike its neighboring cemetery, Graceland, Rosehill’s monuments are a bit more subdued. 
Several Chicago mayors and other notables including Richard Sears, the founder of Sears Roebuck & Co., Aaron Montgomery Ward, the founder of Montgomery Ward & Co., and John G. Shedd, the founder of the Shedd aquarium are entombed here. Rosehill is also home to a large Civil War memorial and Firefighter’s memorial."	Chicago's largest cemetery is full of beautiful Victorian monuments and more than a few ghost stories.
