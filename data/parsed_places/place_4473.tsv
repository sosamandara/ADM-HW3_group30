Egan's Ballard Jam House	['Unique Restaurants & Bars']	155	627	"Egan’s Ballard Jam House provides a welcoming community space for practicing and workshopping music before transforming nightly into a restaurant and venue.
This Seattle club was established by virtual reality researcher Susan Weghorst after watching her son take saxophone lessons and realizing that there was a need for space where jazz music could be honored and passed down from its very practitioners. Her grandfather, Jack Egan, being a composer and performer of ragtime music himself, Weghorst named the venue after him since she wanted the space to have the same feel as classic jazz-era musician’s clubs. In addition to the musical offerings, the all-ages space offers a full menu, making it a great place to spend an entire artful night. 
While Egan’s Ballard Jam House is focused on jazz music and culture, the space also plays hosts to bands of other genres and other cultural events such as literary readings. No matter the happening, the jam house maintains a focus on sharing the spirit of creative freedom that jazz was built on. Stop by and sing along with jazz and blues renditions of popular music!"	This jazz venue welcomes performers nightly and students daily.
