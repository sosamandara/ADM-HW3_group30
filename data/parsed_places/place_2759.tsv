“This sculpture depicts a female figure stirring from her slumber beneath the earth. Carved from Indiana limestone, the sculpture excites imagination and brings inspiration to its viewers. The “Awaking Muse” references the muses of Greek mythology. The Greek muses were goddess sisters who inspired mortals with great thoughts in the arts and sciences.”
The Muse is comfortably situated on the beautifully landscaped grounds of Schaumburg’s Robert O. Atcher Municipal Center. During warmer months, the grounds and its lake are graced by the presence of Louis and Serena, the village’s beloved trumpeter swans."	The face of a woman pushes its way through the earth.
