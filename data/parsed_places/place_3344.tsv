45th Parallel Marker	['location markers', 'marvelous maps and measures', 'geographic markers']	207	429	"One of a series of geographical markers set up by local newspaper editor Frank Noyes in the 1930s, some of the markers commemorate the exact half-way point between the North Pole and Equator, while others mark crossings of the 45th Latitude line (these are not the same point).
This marking of the 45th Parallel is located in a small roadside park along the highway and is a lovely place to stop for a picnic."	Almost half-way between the Equator and North Pole.
