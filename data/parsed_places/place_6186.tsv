Flamingo Habitat	['wildlife sanctuaries', 'hotels', 'gardens', 'plants', 'animals']	1472	956	"The city of Las Vegas does its absolute best to bring the whole world to The Strip, featuring a replica of the New York City skyline, a 460 foot Eiffel Tower, a giant Egyptian sphinx, and the Grand Canal of Venice. But right off the main drag, Las Vegas also boasts a tiny piece of tropical Florida: the Flamingo Habitat.
Inside the aptly-named Flamingo Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip, the Flamingo Habitat is situated on 15 acres of lush tropical grounds in the center of the hustle and bustle of the Entertainment Capital of the World. Scattered along the winding garden pathways are parrots, swans, hummingbirds, pelicans, turtles, koi fish, and, to the delight of all visitors, a flock of flamboyant flamingos.
Resting on Flamingo Island in the exotic gardens of the Flamingo Hotel, dozens of pink Chilean flamingos prance across the verdant landscape, feeding on aquatic life and admiring the hotel’s beautiful waterfalls. The tranquil environment provides a relaxing escape from the fast-paced world of Las Vegas gambling. On daily presentations at 8:30am and 11am, tourists can learn about these unique creatures in between rounds of poker and tropical drinks at the adjacent Jimmy Buffett’s Margaritaville.
Unknown to many, the majority of The Strip—including the Flamingo Hotel—is not actually located within the city limits of Las Vegas, but rather the unincorporated place of Paradise. The Flamingo Habitat surely seems to live up this reputation: a little piece of paradise in Sin City."
