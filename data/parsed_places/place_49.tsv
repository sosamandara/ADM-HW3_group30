Hamilton Pool	['follies and grottoes', 'geological oddities', 'caves', 'natural wonders', 'ecosystems', 'water', 'geology', 'nature']	985	4148	"Just 23 miles west of Austin, Texas, is a breathtaking natural oasis emerging out of the hill country chaparral.
Hamilton Pool is a natural spring formed in the limestone bedrock and fed by an underground river, which also feeds the small tributaries and lush flora surrounding the pool. The abundant freshwater has allowed a diverse population of trees and vegetation to emerge surrounding the pool, forming what is now a protected nature preserve.
The first thing visitors marvel at is the deep overhang etched into the far wall of the pool — remnants of a natural dome that once concealed the entire grotto underground until it collapsed more than a century ago. The sheer cavern now provides deep shade and rocky exploration for visitors.
Waterfalls routinely fall from the lip of the overhang, flowing down the 50-foot drop and splashing into the cool water below, making this a beautiful and refreshing location for sunbaked summer adventurers and swimmers. In case of the high levels of certain bacteria, the pool is closed for swimming.
Besides being a popular tourist attraction, this place is a rich ecosystem. The ceiling of the pool and cliffs surrounding the grotto are home to moss, cliff swallows, and maidenhair fern."
