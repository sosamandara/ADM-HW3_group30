Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory	['ice cream shops', 'ice cream']	304	992	"Called “creamy, ethereally light and perfectly balanced” by the NYTimes, and rated as “the best ice cream in New York” by Frommer’s New York City 2011 and New York City for Dummies, the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory is doing something right.
This can be seen at the other location in Dumbo, where the lines can extend for nearly a block. So it is with some surprise and delight that one finds the Greenpoint location hidden at the very end of Manhattan Ave. Quiet, often empty, yet still filled with same delicious ice-cream, it was set up as the factory for the Dumbo location, and the small shop in front was added on at the request of the building owner. 
Never a line, and almost always a place to sit, if you happen to stop by when owner Mark Thompson is in, he will gladly talk NY history with you. For everyone exploring on Field Trip Day, from 1pm-9pm, a small cone or single scoop is free. We suggest the Butter Pecan."	The factory for the popular Dumbo location, the Greenpoint shop is a quiet gem.
