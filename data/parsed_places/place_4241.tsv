The Southern California Medical Museum	['medical libraries', 'medical museums']	37	540	"A collection of medical artifacts, medical photograph, a medical library dating back to 1843, and a recreated doctor’s office from the 1920s, complete with vintage medicines, roll-top desk, microscope and medical bag.
A lecture held in the museum entitled, “Quackery, or Not?” displayed a curious cure-all from the same era, a metal cylinder known as the Oxygenator. Though it cured nothing, it was true to its name: it had nothing inside it but air."	A small medical museum with a recreated doctor's office.
