Hanging Lake	['natural wonders', 'water', 'nature']	853	3742	"1,000 feet up the steep walls of Glenwood Canyon there hides away a basin full of water the color of Paris Green, waterfalls roaring near the fragile shoreline of travertine, the bottom of the lake fully visible through crystal clear waters.
Discovered by a gold hunting prospector, Hanging Lake was a private homestead and family retreat until falling into the hands of Glenwood Springs in 1910. Protected by the White River Forest Service, this is a popular stop for those willing to take a short but steep hike to see the trout-filled, glacially formed watery haven seemingly suspended from the side of the canyon.
Just a few hundred yards behind Hanging Lake is yet another waterfall, Spouting Rock, which jets through holes in the canyon walls."	Crystal clear lake with a shoreline of travertine located in a Colorado canyon.
