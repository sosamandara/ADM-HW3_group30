Cloverland Ghost Town	['abandoned cemeteries', 'agriculture', 'ghost towns', 'abandoned', 'history']	54	633	"Situated in Washington’s Asotin County, the town of Cloverland was first formed at the start of the 1900s and reached its peak in 1910 with a mere population of 400 people. As of today, few buildings from its short-lived existance remain.
Cloverland was built in hopes of forming booming orchards and irrigated fields. Unfortunately, all attempts failed, leaving only those who could afford to purchase enough land to raise livestock able to make a living. The town was eventually abandoned and left to the elements.
Currently, the Cloverland Garage is still standing in the center of town. As you drive in from Asotin, you will see the garage on your right. It was actually initially built as a general store but was converted into a garage in 1918 as cars became more readily available to eastern Washingtonians. Today the building is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.
Across the road from the garage stands the old Barkley Hotel. It was a prime location for travelers in its heyday, as Cloverland was once on the main road that connected Lewiston, Idaho to Wallowa, Oregon. Today, the hotel is used as a residence and it’s said that the upstairs rooms are still numbered.
A little over a mile away from the garage is the Cloverland Cemetery, where you can see for yourself when the population of Cloverland was at its peak. Most of the gravestones in the cemetery are dated from the early 1900s."	The century-old remains of an abandoned farm town in eastern Washington.
