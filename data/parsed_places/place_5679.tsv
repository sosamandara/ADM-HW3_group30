Conserveira de Lisboa	['canned fish', 'fish', 'shops']	370	537	"From war food to convenient cooking, canned food has gone a long way.
Conserveira de Lisboa was born in the 1930s and has since specialized in canned fish. What started as a small grocery store soon grew into a multi-generational family business that continues to attract fish lovers from all over the world. 
Stacked in wooden shelves, the colorful tins are as much of a treat for the eyes as for your taste buds, thanks to its fashionable retro packaging. The tins hold some of the best fish in Portugal including tuna, cod, sardines, mackerel, and eel, mostly from Portuguese waters. These delicacies are preserved into a range of mixes from olive oil to lemon and spicy tomato sauce.
Pick up your favorite tin and watch as the staff carefully wraps it up for you, just like in the good old days."	The best place in the world to buy canned fish.
