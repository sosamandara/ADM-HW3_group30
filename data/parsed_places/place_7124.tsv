Tinglewood Carvings	['trees', 'outsider art', 'parks', 'plants']	247	926	"Montevallo, Alabama’s Orr Park is a lovely natural area that is a fine park, worth a visit in its own right, but the main attractions are the fantastical tree carvings of Tim Tingle.
Orr Park contains two playgrounds, six baseball/softball fields (often in use by the local middle and high schools), a walking trail, a football field, and a soccer field. There are also plenty of opportunities for wading in the creek (although swimming is not allowed), and there are picnic shelters as well. Of course, if you want to just spread your blanket in the shade beneath some of the beautiful trees, nobody will stop you. This unique nature preserve is all about getting people outside and back into nature.
Several of the older trees in the park were destroyed in a storm that came through the area in 1993, and instead of allowing the trees to be cut down and taken away, Mr. Tingle began carving them to add to the beauty of Orr Park. Today, squirrels, men, alligators, and even a dragon are carved on dead trees all around the park, adding to the mystic nature of the already beautiful scenery. Only dead trees expand his menagerie; living trees are left alone. There are over 30 carvings around the park, and more are always being created.
A book detailing all of the “Tinglewood Carvings” is available through Montevallo City Hall.
The Tinglewood Festival, started in September 2018, is held every year at Orr Park, usually on the first Saturday in September."	Orr Park's dead trees have been carved into a menagerie of whimsical visages.
