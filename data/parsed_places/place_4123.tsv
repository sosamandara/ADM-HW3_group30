Senoia Main Street	['zombies', 'pop culture', 'television', 'film locations', 'roadside attractions']	301	447	"The small city of Senoia, Georgia, has a long history of hosting movie and television crews. Most recently, it’s hosted hordes of zombies—or, rather, regular humans dressed as zombies.
The town has become synonymous with the towns of Woodbury, Hilltop, and Alexandria from Roger Kirkman’s television show and pop culture phenomenon, The Walking Dead. Main Street and the surrounding few blocks are featured in roughly 40 iconic scenes from the show (all of which are conveniently laid out in a map available from the corner store “Table Talk”).
For those who prefer a guided tour, there are multiple options to choose from. There is also a “Waking Dead Cafe” as well as an official store, “The Woodbury Shoppe,” and a museum packed with various props and items autographed by the cast (not the least of which include a signed version of Negan’s bat, “Lucille,” and the famous set of hospital doors inscribed with the words “Don’t Open Dead Inside”).
Don’t be surprised if you come face to face with Abraham Ford sitting behind the desk of the museum. No, it’s not the actor Michael Cudlitz (although you wouldn’t know it), but rather a well-known cosplayer who goes by “German Abraham.”
Just across the train tracks on the South end of Main Street, you will see the unmistakable walled set for the Walking Dead town of Alexandria. 
Despite its long-running connection with The Walking Dead, Senoia has maintained its picturesque and quaint southern charm with a number of boutique stores and local businesses. It also has a “walk of fame” along the sidewalks, featuring some of the other shows and movies that have been shot there, ranging from Drop Dead Diva to Fried Green Tomatoes, Driving Miss Daisy, Broken Bridges, Freejack (which some may recall as Mick Jagger’s film debut), Meet the Browns, and the 2011 remake of Footloose, to name just a few."	The picturesque southern city served as the zombie-filled town of Woodbury in 'The Walking Dead.'
