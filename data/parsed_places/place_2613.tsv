It takes you on a tour through the cradle of civilization, with artifacts from Mesopotamia, Sumer, Egypt, Assyria, Israel, Iran, Nubia, and more.
Housed in a beautiful historic building, the museum holds many surprising gems. Highlights include the ancient Temple of Sargon, built for the Assyrian King Sargon II; an exhibit on the evolution of writing from symbols to clay tablets; mathematical proofs from Babylonian times; artifacts from the Hebrew Bible; and a remarkable Egyptian collection. Wandering through these treasures, you will half expect to see Indiana Jones around the corner."	This surprising gem is a world-class archeological museum hidden at the University of Chicago.
