The Big Chair	['big chairs', 'roadside attractions', 'shops', 'monuments', 'statues']	378	652	"In the late ’50s, before the widespread availability of mass communication, local businesses had to take drastic steps to advertise themselves, and it was with this in mind that Washington DC furniture company Curtis Brothers Furniture built The Big Chair.
This self-explanatory monument stands 19½ feet tall and was at one time the largest chair in America. The chair was originally made out of wood but after years being battered by the elements the monument became unstable and had to be deconstructed for repairs. Instead of replacing the wooden structure the chair was rebuilt with aluminum so that the over-sized furniture would last for future generations to enjoy. The chair also garnered further local fame shortly after its construction when artist Lynn Arnold lived atop the chair for 42 days without coming down. It must be comfortable."	A super-sized promotional trick that is now a DC landmark.
