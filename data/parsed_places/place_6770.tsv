Alabama's Natural Bridge	['geological oddities', 'caves', 'ecosystems', 'geology']	306	1668	"Amidst blindingly green foliage and stunning rock formations is Alabamaâ€™s Natural Bridge, a sprawling sandstone and iron ore bridge formed over 200 million years ago.
Just outside William Bankhead National Forest, the overpass spans a small cave area with a curved rock formation 148 feet long and 60 feet high. Although the area was recognized as a national park in 1954, Native Americans had been dwelling in the area and underneath the natural bridge for hundreds of years.
Just a short walk from the bridge is a mysterious carving of an Indian head, similar to that on the buffalo nickel. Despite some guesses that the carving depicts a chief from the area, almost nothing is known about who created the relief, when, or for what purpose.
Visitors strolling through the park can take in the incredible landscape for just $3.50. Unfortunately, you are no longer allowed to walk over the bridge for safety purposes, as there are no guard rails, and the 200-million-year old bridge cannot be trusted to hold thousands of visitors each month."	148 feet long and in the middle of a verdant forest.
