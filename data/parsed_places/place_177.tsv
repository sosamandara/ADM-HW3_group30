Verde Hot Springs Resort		75	601	"Built in the 1920s, this abandoned hot spring resort is rumored (though unproven) to have been the vacation spot of the notorious gangster, Al Capone. 
In 1962, the once sought after resort burned down leaving only foundation stones and two hot springs overlooking the Verde Valley. The smaller spring is housed within the last nearly-intact structure on the abandoned resort and is a balmy 100˚farenheit and large enough for three or four adults to sit and relax.
There is no roof to this little hut, and no windows although a doorway and all four walls remain. These walls are wildly decorated with art and inscriptions dating back decades. The paintings and drawings range from the inspirational to the commemorative to the downright naughty."	A once popular resort—said to be the vacation spot of gangster Al Capone—now remains abandoned in the woods of Arizona.
