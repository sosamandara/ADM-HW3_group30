Bridges of Ross	['rock formations', 'birds', 'bridges', 'natural wonders', 'nature', 'animals']	53	433	"This lone sea arch is rugged West Clare at its best. The top of the structure is blanketed by a verdant layer of grass. Below, wind-whipped water thrashes against the cliffs.
Though the name implies multiple bridges, there’s actually only one. Originally, the area boasted three incredible natural sea arches. But after centuries of erosion—the very same phenomenon that created the geological features—two of them crumbled into the sea below, leaving one surviving bridge.
You can’t see the natural bridge from the road, but it’s worth the short trek along the cliffs. It’s a fantastic spot to watch the wild Atlantic Ocean. With the sun at your back, you can watch the waves churn toward the shore beneath a seemingly endless expanse of sky.
If you’re a keen birder, you’ll definitely want to turn your eyes skyward, as the Bridges of Ross is a great spot for birdwatching. During the autumn migration, thousands of seabirds fly close to the shore during their southward travels. Keep an eye out for species like Manx Shearwater, Storm Petrels, Little Auks, and more."	This natural sea arch highlights Ireland's rugged coastal beauty.
