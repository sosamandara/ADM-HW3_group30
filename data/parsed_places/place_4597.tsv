FAST Fiberglass Mold Graveyard	['sculpture gardens', 'industrial', 'sculptures', 'statues']	319	1184	"Littering the field behind the workshop of giant-building firm Fiberglass Animals, Shapes, and Trademarks (FAST) is an eerie collection of titanic molds, left over from almost every job theyâ€™ve ever done.
FAST specializes in creating giant, eye-grabbing figures and items, the likes of which one might see outside of kitschy roadside restaurants and gas stations across the country. After a job, the company keeps the mold and stores it in the field out back. Now there are hundreds of giant, unpainted forms scattered all across the lot in every imaginable variety and shape. There are giant skulls and colossal dogs; oversized Santa Clauses and titanic mice. The fiberglass of the molds has weathered, giving the molds the feeling of ancient stone, as though the yard was left over from some surreal ancient culture.
The operators of FAST welcome visitors who want to stroll among the collection. They do warn you to look out for hornet nests, although whether they mean giant or otherwise is unclear."	These molds for fiberglass statues have formed an eerie, accidental sculpture park.
