Noir Arts & Oddities	['oddities', 'shops', 'collections']	162	842	"Seated in one of the oldest industrial areas of Kansas City, Missouri is the Noir Arts & Oddities boutique owned by Pamela Smith. The shop, which is self-described as “creepy but cool,” curates a collection of macabre items blended with a Victorian charm.
Hedged by 19th-century brick buildings said to contain infamous haunted houses, Noir Arts & Oddities is a shop that has absorbed and reflects the dark beauty of this period setting. Filled with funerary antiques, taxidermy, medical antiques, natural science specimens, and more; stepping over the weathered threshold means a customer will be confronted with the fascinating and unusual. 
Suffice it to say, Noir Arts & Oddities specializes in the strange and freakish. The majority of stock is hand-picked by Smith and her son to create a shop where a customer can own something exclusive and one-of-a-kind. In addition to selling unusual items, the shop also aims to support local artists in the Kansas City area, which includes illustrators, photographers, and creators.
Update as of December 2020: Noir Arts & Oddities will close on 12/31/2020 and will operate as an online parlor and community."	Tucked away between two 19th-century buildings, this small shop specializes in the macabre.
