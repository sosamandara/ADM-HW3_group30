The bait shop is abandoned and can be visited by tourists looking to poke around a dilapidated shop, but the really quirky bit about this place is that the front lot is filled with a half dozen old ice storage boxes. An interesting and unexpected sight for anybody unaware of its presence.
Update May 1, 2016: the Ice Box Cemetery is no longer in existence. It appears someone took the ice boxes and left an old dilapidated RV."
