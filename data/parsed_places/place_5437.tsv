Worcester State Hospital	['relics and reliquaries', 'monuments', 'abandoned', 'ruins']	249	743	"As this once-proud mental health facility ages and succumbs to demolition, new plans rise in its wake. But much of the history and intrigue that belonged with the ruins are being lost.
Worcester State Hospital is an abandoned mental hospital off of Route 9 in Worcester, Massachusetts.Â In the 1870s, Worcester State Hospital was a campus of buildings, but now only two of those buildings remain, including the famously spooky and distinctive clock tower.
As of 2015, the historic clock tower has been made into a memorial in honor of the original site and its impact on the practice of psychiatry.
Unfortunately for most explorers and ghost hunters, the remaining original building (with the exception of the Hooper Turret) has been completely demolished."	A spooky and decrepit mental health facility is slowly being replaced with newer digs.
