The Dorn Pyramid	['pyramids', 'tombs', 'catacombs and crypts', 'cemeteries']	228	800	"In 1905 a wealthy lawyer, Fred Adolphus Dorn, lost his wife and son during childbirth and in their honor erected a mysterious pyramid tomb. The front of the tomb bears the eerie words “DISTVRB NOT THE SLEEP OF DEATH”.
The pyramid stands strangely alone and isolated. This is because of its weight, the location was the only one with solid enough rock to support the massive mausoleum. Two stones lie in front of the door waiting to be cemented in place once all the Dorns are laid to rest inside."	A Mysterious Masonic tomb in San Luis Obispo.
