The Devil Heads	['outsider art', 'sculptures']	91	757	"A disturbing sight awaits hikers exploring the forest above the village of Želízy in Kokořínsko, a protected landscape area in Czechia. There, two enormous demonic faces carved from the native stone stare back with empty eyes.
Created by Vaclav Levy in the mid-1800s, the nearly 30-foot-tall stone heads are known locally as Certovy Hlavy or the “The Devil Heads.” They have been a local attraction for generations. Other carvings by the artist, including artificial caves and scenes inspired by fairy tales, adorn nearby rock faces.
Now suffering slightly from the ravages of time and weather, the faces have grown less distinct over time, but no less disturbing."	Two monstrous faces loom over a village in Czechia.
