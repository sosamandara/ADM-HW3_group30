Victoria's Last Resort	['places to stay', 'shops']	40	507	"This B&B is like stepping into your own special art piece. The carpets are leopard, the fireplaces are mosaics inside, and the guest suite has a crazy mosaic shower that is a must-see to believe. The place is quirky and completely private. That’s right, just one guest at a time.
Victoria’s Last Resort’s Royal Treatment will spoil you for any other option. Not a traditional bed and breakfast, this is a bed and brunch and your brunch is always served when you are ready. You also get a four-course dinner fireside and plenty of special treats all tailored to your likes. Every detail is thought of … even the soaps are made by Victoria.
