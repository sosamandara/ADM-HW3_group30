Pet Sematary Filming Sites	['pet cemeteries', 'film locations', 'memento mori', 'catacombs and crypts']	243	1029	"One of many film adaptations of Stephen King’s work, the 1989 film Pet Sematary focuses on a father who loses his two-year-old child, and then attempts to bring him back to life by burying him in an old pet cemetery that was formerly Native American sacred ground.
Pet Sematary had its most central scenes filmed in the towns of Hancock and Bangor in King’s home state of Maine. The red-roofed, yellow-sided house where most of the film takes place is located at 303 Point Road in Hancock and still looks the same.
The human cemetery featured at various points throughout the movie is Mount Hope Cemetery at 1048 State Street in Bangor. It was here that Stephen King cameos in the movie as a minister presiding over a funeral. The exact spot can be found on the State Street side of the cemetery, right up against a steep hill with a stone staircase cut into it. It was on the side of that steep hill, to the left of a set of stairs if you’re ascending them and around the vicinity of the Bragg plot, where the father disinters his son.
