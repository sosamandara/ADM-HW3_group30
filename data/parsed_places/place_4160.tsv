Redux Boutique and Gallery	['jewelry', 'recycling', 'wunderkammers', 'stores', 'taxidermy', 'shops', 'collections']	104	623	"Since 2006, this quirky Portland shop has been a bit like a wunderkammer—but in this cabinet of wonders, everything is for sale. The boutique peddles a medley of handmade and homespun goods, from beautifully macabre curiosities to jewelry and gifts fashioned from recycled materials.
In the sunny store, shoppers can sift through repurposed bangles and baubles, including jewelry made from car parts, typewriter keys, magnifying glasses, discarded bullet casings, old briefcase straps, and bits of bike chains.
The shop specializes in local goods—more than half of the wares are made by artists based in the Pacific Northwest—and makes many items in-house, too, including journals bound with floppy disks and wanderlust-inspiring lamps made from globes. The store stocks work from more than 300 artisans and small companies, and has recently begun working with some that are farther afield. Now, near windchimes made from cutlery in Portland, you’ll also find laser-cut vinyl clocks fashioned in Kyiv, and punchy jewelry made from guitar strings and shipped from the United Kingdom.
The space is also stuffed with tons of natural wonders and curios, including butterflies, flora, and other specimens preserved in resin. There’s plenty of sustainably sourced or scavenged taxidermy, too, including bone-laden shadowboxes by the company WolfTea. Those mingle snakeskin, porcupine needles, teeth, feathers, antlers, wildflowers, and other finds gathered near the founders’ rural Washington homestead.
The shop moonlights as a gallery, too: Wander in on the first Friday any month, and as you browse, you can also check out exhibitions featuring work by local artists."	This Portland shop is brimming with natural wonders, local art, and handmade goods fashioned from recycled materials.
