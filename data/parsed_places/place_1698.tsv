Norwich State Hospital	['abandoned hospitals', 'abandoned insane asylums', 'lost wonders', 'ruins']	199	748	"Norwich State Hospital operated from 1904 to 1996, and since then has fallen into an eerie state of disrepair.
The first patients were prisoners, although this expanded into the geriatric and drug users. 
Underground passageways built under the complex were used to transport equipment and reportedly were also used as a place to torture patients with cruel mental health treatments. Paranormal investigators and urban explorers still seek access to these dark tunnels, which can still be used to reach the abandoned hospital.  
In 2014, most of the buildings were torn down. The administration building has been saved with plans for future development, and a few other buildings remain.  In 2017 the Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority announced plans to build new facilities on the site, including an indoor water park, a senior living center, and a sports complex.
Update March 2019: Almost all of the hospital’s buildings were demolished and the tunnels have been excavated and filled to clear out the property for construction."	Underground tunnels remain beneath this abandoned mental asylum.
