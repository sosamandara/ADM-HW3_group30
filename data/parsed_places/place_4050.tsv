Cheoah Dam	['dams']	160	493	"At one end of the Tail of the Dragon, Highway 129 crosses an imposing 225-foot dam, wedged into a narrow gorge of the Little Tennessee River. In the 1993 film, The Fugitive, Harrison Ford’s character makes a heart-stopping leap from the top of the dam to elude capture. Ford actually did stand on this precipice, although it was a temporary tunnel built for the film overlooking the drop. The scene involved six dummies valued at well over $40,000. 
The Cheoah Dam at the time of its construction was the tallest overflow dam in the world with the world’s largest turbines. Behind the dam is a scenic mountain lake. Also, not far from the Cheoah, are the remnants of the train wreck scene also featured in the film."	A historic dam made famous for its turbines and feature in a Hollywood classic.
