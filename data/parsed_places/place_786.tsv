Chained Rock	['roadside attractions', 'geological oddities', 'natural wonders', 'monuments', 'geology', 'nature']	164	573	"Chained Rock is a massive boulder that looms over Pineville, Kentucky, threatening to roll down Pine Mountain, destroying the whole town, were it not for the massive chain tethering it to the mountain.
While the story of the chained rock is compelling, it was actually created by Pineville locals who were looking to create a tourist attraction near their small town. Thus in the 1930s the town installed the huge, 101-foot length of heavy-duty chain, linking one end to a colossal boulder on Pine Mountain and attaching the other end to the mountain itself. The rock is still a popular tourist attraction and even has its own informational plaque for visitors."	This boulder stays on its mountain thanks to a huge chain and on the map due to local legend.
