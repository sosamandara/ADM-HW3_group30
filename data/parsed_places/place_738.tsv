Fantasy Canyon	['rocks', 'roadside attractions', 'geological oddities', 'natural wonders', 'geology', 'nature']	174	1613	"Northeastern Utah is full of interesting rock formations caused by a mix of erosion and porous stone, but none is quite so otherworldly as Fantasy Canyon.
Located about an hour outside of Vernal, Utah, Fantasy Canyon is home to several strange rock formations. While not as large as some of the other desert attractions in the state, the smooth, undulating ridges and loops at Fantasy Canyon seem like they were transported straight from a science-fiction film.
The formations are the product of ancient rivers and lakes that used to cover the area, depositing layers of sand and mud that hardened into rock before being sculpted into mystical shapes by the elements. Visitors can take the short hike into the canyon and have a sit on the single round bench. Itâ€™s almost like taking a siesta on the surface of Mars."	Sandstone rock formations that look like they belong on the cover of a progressive rock album.
