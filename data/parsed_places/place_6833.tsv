The Marshall House	['civil war', 'haunted', 'hotels']	420	479	"In the oldest city in Georgia, you are bound to hear a surplus of ghost stories. In Savannah, it seems every location has a unique set of ghost stories. The Marshall House is home to quite a few.
This haunted history comes from the hotelâ€™s time as a Civil War hospital. Between 1864-1865 Union troops wounded during the conflict were treated at the hotel. There have been reports throughout the decades of hearing/seeing ghosts in the hallways, sounds of doorknobs rattling, faucets with a mind of their own, and so many more ghostly tales. A visit to this former hospital may illicit a few disembodied voices or chilling touch from a former Union soldier."	An early-19th-century hotel with a past that steeped in the Civil War.
