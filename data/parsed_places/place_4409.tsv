Museum Moderner Kunst (MUMOK) pride themselves on their extensive collection of 20th and 21st century modern art, and their status as the largest art museum in Austria. This may or may not be why a small family home attempted to bring them down by hurtling itself into the roof of the museum, wedging its roof helplessly into the mammoth’s frame.
Artist Erwin Wurm is known for his unusual, sometimes humorous, and occasionally puzzling work. While his “House Attack” piece could fall into any or all of those categories, it’s at the very least intriguing. The sensation of walking underneath a house that is perched in such a precarious position may spark a natural instinct to move out from under it with haste, but from a distance it’s hard not to smirk at the implied predicament of the little guy.
Located in the heart of Vienna, House Attack is the first modern art piece you will see when arriving at the museum, but go inside to see an extensive collection of international art, including works from classical modernity, Cubism, Futurism and Surrealism up to the art movements of the 1960s and 1970s, Pop Art, Fluxus and Nouveau Réalisme."
