World's Largest Popcorn Ball	['giant spheres', 'spheres', 'food art', 'monuments', 'statues', 'food']	149	436	"Sac City, Iowa, isn’t known for much. But what it is known for - the world’s largest ball of popcorn - it is quite proud of. The ball draws in visitors from all over (and many who are directed to the city and its popcorn ball, which is stored in a shed, by billboards that run alongside the nearby highways), which helps nearby businesses with tourism dollars.
The ball of popcorn is believed to weigh around 9,370 pounds. It measured eight feet in diameter and has a circumference of just over 24 feet.
The ball of popcorn in Sac City was remade in February of 2009 by more than 250 volunteers who spent 12 hours and 40 minutes constructing the sculpture. The reconstruction required 900 pounds of popcorn, more than 2,500 pounds of sugar, and 1,400 pounds of syrup."	Eight feet in diameter and more than 24 feet around.
