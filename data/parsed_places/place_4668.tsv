Seattle Pinball Museum	['pinball', 'arcades', 'collections', 'museums']	568	2143	"Located in Seattle’s Chinatown are 54 classic pinball machines all waiting to be played. 
Spanning decades of classic pinball, some of the machines date back to 1963, and all of them are playable. Started as a married couple’s personal home collection they call pinball collecting “an incurable disease.” The museum has also hosted some unique machines created by artists, all fully playable of course. Clearly, a labor of love, both the owners continue to hold down regular jobs while running the pinball museum on the side. 
The museum has an admission cost of $20, but once inside all the machines are free to play, and beer and soda are available for purchase."	Couple's personal collection of pinball machines turned public pinball museum.
