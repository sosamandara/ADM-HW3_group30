Atami Adult Museum	['collections']	53	881	"The city of Atami, located in the far eastern corner of Shizuoka Prefecture is famous for its hot springs, and in fact its name translates into “hot ocean”, but that’s not the only thing heating up this seaside town.
Atami also claims one of Japan’s best ‘Hihokan’, the euphemistic expression used for sex museums meaning “House of Hidden Treasures”. With three levels of exhibits covering a multitude of positions on Japanese sexuality, this cliffside collection is a popular stop that gives visitors a sexy, silly, and sometimes just weird experience into Japanese sex culture.
Arriving by cable car, guests can marvel at the amazing view from the cliffs before delving into the museum which contains an array of enticing displays, including traditional Japanese sex artwork, holograms, figurines depicting fetishes such as Hentai and bondage, and abstract nude mannequin art. 
On the sillier side, which will provide awkward conversation but also makes it less creepy to be in a sex museum with your friends or family, are the more interactive displays. A carnival-like shooting game that blows up a Can-Can dancers dress when the bullseye is hit, a wind machine that when cranked, blows a life-sized Marilyn Monroe’s dress up ala “The Seven Year Itch”, and a giant penis ride you can climb on for a mere 100Yen. 
Despite the naughty theme, this museum is enjoyed by young and old, as long as the young are over 18. You must be at least as tall as the whale penis replica to enjoy this collection, or have valid I.D. It is is accessible by road and also the Atami Ropeway. The Atami sex museum itself is located just in front of Atami Castle."	Museum showcases Japanese sexuality and some amazing ocean views.
