While the area is known for its cross-country skiing, H₂O takes on a different role in Lagenfeld. The outdoor pools are just one way. There’s also saunas, baths and steam rooms for a selection of ways to relax with what is probably humans’ favorite molecule.
The area has been used since the 16th century. At the Aqua Dome, officially approved as a mineral spa under Tyrolean spa law, warm spring water rises from below.
To add to the watery selection of attractions, there’s also a variety of interesting architectural features, most notably the three UFO-esque pools. These pools were constructed to give the swimmer a further sense of weightlessness in addition to their natural buoyancy. A 100°C sauna, shower world, ice-cold grotto and trail of alternating cold, warm, then cold water are also highlights.
In addition to the unique spa, there is an attached hotel.
