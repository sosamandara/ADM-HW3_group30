Nancy Forrester's Secret Garden	['sanctuaries', 'birds', 'gardens', 'plants', 'animals']	184	814	"Nancy Forrester’s Secret garden is a must-see on your Key West adventure. It’s a magical, wondrous sanctuary for both the people who visit and the rescued birds who call the place home.
Nancy Forrester, an environmental activist and educator, founded the sanctuary decades ago to care for unwanted and abandoned parrots. Guests are welcome to visit and entertain the intelligent, social birds. Every day, Nancy hosts a “Parrot 101” where visitors can ask questions about and even hold some of the avian residents.
Walking into the snarls of leafy greenery is like walking into a plot of jungle, plopped right within a bustling city. Parrots greet you as you enter, some even with a polite “hello.” Their vibrant feathers stand out among the foliage that covers almost every space of the garden.
Once there, you’ll likely also meet Nancy Forrester, the soul behind this amazing hideaway. She is caring and one-of-a-kind. Her passion for the birds is inspiring. After getting to know her and the parrots she’s rescued from abuse and abandonment, you’ll leave with a twinkle in your eye.
Her bird sanctuary relies on donations to keep everything running. Before the garden moved into its current location, Nancy and her parrots lived on the last undeveloped acre in all of Key West. But, sadly, financial troubles forced her to downsize."	Visitors are welcome to enter this lush Key West sanctuary to entertain its plethora of rescued parrots.
