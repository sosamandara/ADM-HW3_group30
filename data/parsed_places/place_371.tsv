Conor Byrne Pub	['shops']	312	546	"This 108-year-old pub carries 57 different whiskeys and hosts live music free of cover most nights of the week, ranging from traditional Irish to alternative indie.  The bar has weekly bluegrass jams and on Tuesday nights hosts an “old-timey social”, in which aged local musicians get together to play their favorite classic tunes. 
Established as the Owl in 1898, Conor Byrne is a lovely bar with exposed red brick walls, 14-foot-high ceilings and a beautiful, heavy, 100-year-old back bar which served as the original bar top.  It’s a well-loved Ballard institution and consistently draws an eclectic mix of neighborhood locals, all flocking to Conor Byrne to enjoy live music over a few cold pints of beer."	One of the oldest continually operating drinking establishments west of the Mississippi.
