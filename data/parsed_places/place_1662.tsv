Wonderville	['pinball', 'arcades', 'games']	138	1101	"Filled with handmade gaming cabinets, 16-person multiplayer games, pinball machines that trigger strobe lights, and games featuring nothing but LED strips, Wonderville is an arcade like no other.
For years, Wonderville co-founder Mark Kleback showcased the world’s most strange and inventive games through the Death By Audio Arcade collective, founded out of the now-shuttered Death By Audio space, which emphasized local multiplayer games and social connection.
In 2019, he and his partner in both life and business, Stephanie Gross, founded an arcade space that invites all veteran and novice players to come together and explore the medium. With a growing trend of games being played at home in isolation, this push to bring players together started the journey to Wonderville through their DIY Arcade Cabinets and strong support from the local development scene.
Today, the venue features a rotating collection of independent video games that will shatter your expectation of what a game might be, blend art and technology in innovative ways, and perhaps inspire you to make a game yourself. A recent exhibit, for example, featured video games that were played with anything but a controller like a juicer, or another that was played through a doorstop.
Wonderville doesn’t end with games, it’s also a space for New York artists and musicians to congregate and feel at home. Wonderville hosts an array of free and ticketed events from visual art shows, to techno music, to comedy, to seminars."	An arcade packed with a rotating collection of unique independent video games.
