Walnut Canyon	['national parks', 'natural wonders', 'nature', 'ruins']	843	1148	"Ancient cliff dwelling ruins amidst geological beauty.
The Sinagua people of arid Arizona were a pre-Colombian people who lived in Walnut Canyon circa 1100 CE to 1250 CE. The canyon was formed by Walnut Creek, and lies on the Colorado Plateau. Here, the Sinagua built around 80 dwellings beneath ledges of Kaibab limestone. Though they were adept at thriving in such a dry climate, and are even thought to have established a trading empire that extended towards Central America, why they abandoned their small community in Walnut Canyon remains a mystery. The picturesque site is now a protected national monument and visitors can walk through the ruins of the pueblos nestled beneath the cliffs."	Ancient pueblos built into the base of a natural canyon wall.
