Lakenenland	['inventions', 'monuments', 'statues']	253	408	"An outdoor sculpture park with about 80 different iron sculptures build out of scraps, Lakenenland is the playground of Tom Lakenen. “I recently built a band shell out of scrap material also, for anyone to use for open jam sessions or whatever you need a band shell for,” Lakenen wrote on his personal website. “There is a lean-to shelter with a fire pit for anyone enjoying the great outdoors in the winter, two ponds for kids to fish in the summer....”
Lakenen visits the park nearly every weekend in the winter and as often as he is able the rest of the year. He’s there to provide tours and continue adding to the site. There’s nothing to buy and no admission fee (though donations are welcome and appreciated); Lakenen is just using the place as a form of personal entertainment while trying to build something that others will be able to enjoy in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula.
Lakenen has built a path that loops through the area - it will take about 10 minutes to trek through if you don’t stop to enjoy the sculptures - but the elderly or handicapped can also drive through to see his constructions. Some of the sculptures are of Seuss-like creatures, some political, some fanciful. They were built purely for fun and self-expression and have been described as refreshingly unassuming."
