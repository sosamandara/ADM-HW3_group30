Hindenburg Crash Site	['crash site', 'disaster areas', 'disasters', 'memento mori']	267	931	"On May 6, 1937, the Hindenburg disaster took the lives of 35 people and left in its wake some of the most shocking and captivating disaster footage and photos the world will ever know.
During an attempt to land at Lakehurst Naval Air Station, the Hindenburg airship caught fire and disintegrated into a raging ball of fire near-instantaneously, in a display of rapid combustion unlike any other.Â Despite its enduring legacy as a horrific disaster, less than half of the people on board the Hindenburg actually died. 62 passengers and crew escaped with their lives.
A simple yet powerful memorial marks the site of the crash. A cement outline in the shape of the Hindenburg stretches across the airfield in the spot where the airship crash-landed in flames.
The site was declared a Registered National Historic Landmark in 1961."	The site of one of history's most indelible and horrific tragedies.
