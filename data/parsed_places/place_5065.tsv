Elliott Smith's Tribute Wall	['music', 'memorials']	474	653	"Those who loved the dark music of Elliott Smith already know the tragic tale of his death.
The doomed singer/songwriter, who weaved tales of depression and addiction into his melodic stories was found dead in his Echo Park home with two stab wounds to the chest. Ruled a suicide, some believe he was murdered. Devastated fans flocked to Solutions Studios, where the album cover for “Figure 8” was shot. Soon the wall was covered in messages, the street littered with candles, flowers, and empty booze bottles. Eight years later, you can read the sentiments of his fans and member this tortured artist through the eyes and art of his fans."	Pay your respects to a folk-punk legend.
