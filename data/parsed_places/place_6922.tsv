Mirador de Colom (Columbus Monument)	['panoramas', 'monuments']	1247	427	"This 60m tall monument topped by a bronze statue is placed at the site where Columbus landed upon returning from his first trip to the Americas.
The Monument was designed by the Catalan architect Gaietà Buigas i Monravà and the statue was sculpted by Rafael Atché, it stands atop a sculpture of the crown of Catalonia. The interior of the the crown is a small viewing area accessed by an equally small elevator inside the column, providing stunning views of the city and Port Vell. The statue is not pointing towards the new world but possibly in the direction of Columbus home city of Genoa.
Inside the base of the monument, in addition to the elevator is a gift shop where you can purchase tickets to visit the observation deck for 6 euro and also a wine bar and shop."
