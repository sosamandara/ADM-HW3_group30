Toy Joy	['toys', 'purveyors of curiosities', 'inventions']	1185	1267	"Finding a whimsical little toy shop packed with cool vintage toys and novelties is harder than it might sound.
Toy Joy in Austin, Texas, is more than an obscure indie toystore. It’s a wonderland that makes visitors wish they were a kid again. The shop specializes in the sort of gag gifts and thingamajigs that hearken back to a childhood filled with flipping through those obscure mail order catalogs. But that doesn’t stop them from having a downright frightening assortment of Hello Kitty and anime paraphernalia. 
Toy Joy is where the unapologetically weird and the hilariously fun meet. Parents can buy “normal” toys for their infants and children, while people reluctant to call themselves “adults” can browse the store for strange toys and funny objects that defy the ordinary. This has made it a popular stop for touring musicians as well as locals who take the slogan “Keep Austin Weird” to heart. 
The store has recently changed locations and looks, but troll dolls and fetus keychains remain ubiquitous."	A store full of vintage and indie toys designed to bring out the kid in even the crustiest of adults.
