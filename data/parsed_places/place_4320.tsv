Prometheus Esoterica	['oddities', 'stores', 'shops']	130	893	"When visitors first step into Abby Rose Vintage shop, it appears to be just another store to peruse classic objects such as fine china, soaps, and beautiful vintage art.
However, a few steps into a dimly lit back room and visitors are met by grinning skeletons, macabre antiques, and esoteric books. This is Prometheus Esoterica, Winter Parkâ€™s own little oddity shop and gothic boutique. Whether you are shopping for taxidermy needs or looking to add some herbs to your apothecary, Prometheus Esoterica is a must-stop for anyone passing through the Orlando area."	Hidden in the back of this quaint vintage store is an amazing little oddities shop.
