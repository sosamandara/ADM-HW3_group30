Museum of Russian Culture	['collections']	108	769	"When you think San Francisco, you probably don’t think “babushka,” but the Museum of Russian Culture in Pacific Heights showcases Russian culture and the lives of notable Americans of Russian descent. For more than sixty years, the museum has been open to the public for free.
The museum focuses on Russian life before the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. As well as the exhibition hall, the museum is a valuable resource for Russian scholars with rare periodicals from the pre-Revolution era and documents concerning Siberia and the Far East.
The museum is located in the Russian Center of San Francisco, which teaches a range of classes on Russian folk dancing and operates a pre-school. Every February, they host the Russian Festival with food, dance performances, and art."	Russian history in San Francisco.
