Ennis House	['film locations', 'film', 'eccentric homes', 'homes', 'architectural oddities', 'architecture']	777	2867	"The Ennis House is an architectural gem and favorite location for film and TV production.
In the early 1920s Frank Lloyd Wright split his time between completing the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo and a variety of commissions in the Los Angeles area. The Ennis House was designed for Charles and Mable Ennis in 1923 and was completed in 1924. The house is the fourth in a series of homes that have become known as the textile block designs done in Mayan Revival style. It is located on a highly visible lot in the Los Feliz hills.
Earthquakes and rains have taken their toll on the house, which was designated as a Los Angeles Historic Cultural Monument in 1976. Recent renovations have stabilized the building and it remains a private residence rarely open to the public.
The exterior and interior of the house have been used in multiple film and TV productions. In 1959 the exterior was featured in House on Haunted Hill starring Vincent Price. The 1975 production of Day of the Locust also used the location as a private residence. The house became legendary as the inspiration for the apartment of Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) in Ridley Scott’s 1982 film Blade Runner. The exterior was also featured in the TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer as the home of Angelus, Spike, and Drusilla."	"This weird abode has inspired everything from the ""House On Haunted Hill' to a robot hunter's pad."
