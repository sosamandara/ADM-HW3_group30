Olympic Hot Springs	['hot springs', 'natural wonders', 'water', 'nature']	264	2012	"These alkaline mineral water springs consist of 21 seeps located in a bank on Boulder Creek, a tributary of the Elwha River.
Several of these have been created by human-made, rock-lined depressions. The depth of these pools is about one foot. Volunteers have built a series of rock-and-sand soaking pools and conscientious visitors have kept the area litter-free.
The trail is mostly along a paved road and several washouts will be encountered. The pools are across the bridge after the old lodge’s parking area. Consider bringing a towel and something to put your clothes in while soaking, thereby avoiding a possibly wet and uncomfortable hike back out. The springs are located in rain forest environs and are north facing which makes for some difficulty in finding a dry overhang on all but the sunniest of days.
The last pool is about 100 yards up the hill from where the trail appears to end. It’s well worth the extra exertion. The upper pool is the cleanest and has the best views. It’s also the most likely pool to be clothing-optional when the area is crowded.
A resort existed in the area until 1966, when the lease expired. Heavy winter snows caused many of the old buildings to collapse. They were removed, but the seeps remain."
