Videodrome	['stores', 'video', 'film']	358	575	"Videodrome is a special place in east Atlanta where dedicated film buffs have curated an unconventional video rental experience. It has remained strong through the era of streaming and instant movie downloads. Named after the mind-bending cult classic film, Videodrome, by David Cronenberg, this little video rental store has inspired a loyal cult following of its own. Once visitors step inside, they’ll understand why this store is so charming. 
The aisles of Videodrome are filled with expertly curated collections of obscure and mainstream movies ranging from international blockbusters, to little known classics. Most sections are grouped by director and include staff picks to aide in the selection process. The store is an oasis for anyone who loves director’s cuts, special features, or just enjoy discovering new films. Entire sections are dedicated to countries or historical genres, such as Serbian films and the Blaxploitation films of the 1970s. Colorful posters and toys fill in the gaps inside this tactile and immersive video rental experience. 
With its unique charm and cinephilic luster, Videodrome has become an Atlanta institution, beloved by locals and visiting film celebrities. Through its eccentric style, cinematic expertise, and personal touch, this is one video rental store that refuses to die."	This old school, eccentric, and independent video rental store refuses to die.
