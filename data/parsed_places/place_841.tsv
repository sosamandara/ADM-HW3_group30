Candy Cane Lane	['wondrous performances']	528	852	"Zip-lining Santas and atypical, potentially blasphemous art-mangers. That is Woodland Hills come Christmas time.
Since 1952, these eight square blocks of houses have come into friendly, informal competition with one another over who can create the most extravagant or outlandish Christmas or Hanukkah display. Animatronics, Danish nisse, and giant roof-mounted St. Nick busts are not uncommon sights on these streets."	Come crisp December nights, this fairly plain neighborhood becomes a holiday dream world.
