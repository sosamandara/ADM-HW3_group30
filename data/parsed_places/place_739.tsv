Troma Entertainment Inc.	['monsters', 'film']	73	465	"A garage door mural of a friendly cartoon Toxie (The Toxic Avenger) welcomes you to Tromaville as you pass by. 
Troma Entertainment Inc. is one of the longest running, and last existing truly independent film companies. Founded in 1974 by Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz, Troma has produced and distributed over 1,000 B-movies. It was where celebs like Samuel L. Jackson, James Gunn, Eli Roth, and South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone got their start. 
Troma’s trademark is its low budget, campy, knowingly bad films. Movies like Sgt. Kabukiman NYPD and Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead use over-the-top acting and cheap special effects to their comedic advantage. Its most popular production by far was The Toxic Avenger franchise, which revolved around a crime-fighting mop-wielding mutant. By mixing horror, gore, satire, and nostalgia, Troma struck a chord with many B-movie lovers. It is perhaps the best definition of a cult favorite; its merchandise alone is highly sought after by those in the know.
This small two-story studio and production office is a must-see for film fans. If you buzz the doorbell you might just get a free tour."	The best B-movies filmed on a shoestring budget were born here.
