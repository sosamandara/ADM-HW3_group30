Boston Bricks	['bronze', 'public art', 'trails', 'roadside attractions']	290	757	"In a small alleyway a few steps away from Boston’s Freedom Trail is a hidden, whimsical (and quite funny) treasure.
Take a few minutes between Kings Chapel and the Old South Meeting House and detour to Winthrop Lane between Otis and Arch. There, you will find the Boston Bricks.
The project, which is funded by the Browne Fund in Boston and A. W. Perry and Ryan Associates, consists of roughly 100 brick-sized bronze reliefs installed in the paving between the other bricks of Winthrop Lane.
Each installation commemorates a key event within Boston’s past and present. The stones are slightly raised, so they are polished by passersby. On their shiny surfaces, you’ll spot anything from scenes depicting Boston’s notoriously aggressive drivers to a 19th-century baseball glove."	These whimsical works of art tell the story of the city's past and present.
