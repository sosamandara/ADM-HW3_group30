Bisti Badlands	['geological oddities', 'natural wonders', 'geology', 'nature']	397	2521	"Located in the arid desert of northwestern New Mexico, the Bisti Badlands (formally the Bisti/De-Na-Zin Wilderness) offers one of the closest approximations of an unknown alien world as can be found right here on Earth.
The area takes its name not only from the striking stone formations that litter the landscape (“bisti” being a Navajo term meaning “among the adobe formations”), but from petroglyphs of a crane (bird, not construction equipment) that were found in the area—”De-Na-Zin” being the Navajo word for the animal.
The blasted landscape is covered in strange, undulating fungal shapes made of colorful sandstone and shale. Huge hoodoos (tall, thin rock spires) and small labyrinths of odd stone shapes have been created by eons of water and moisture wearing away at a softer layer of ash, creating improbable, top-heavy oddities. You can also find some petrified wood here and there.
Despite looking like a readymade set for a science fiction or fantasy production, the area has not been widely used for filming, save for the 1977 film, Sorcerer."	Seemingly grown on some other world, these New Mexico rock formations look like a disused science fiction set.
