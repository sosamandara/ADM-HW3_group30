Supper Club Tube	['dinner party', 'london', 'vintage', 'england', 'subways', 'trains', 'transportation', 'restaurants', 'Unique Restaurants & Bars']	109	548	"No one steps into the London tube expecting lively conversation—or any conversation at all, for that matter. Nor would anyone in their right mind expect food of any caliber. There is one carriage in East London, however, that people wait weeks to board, in hopes of good company and better food. It doesn’t go anywhere, but no one seems to mind. 
The Supper Club Tube is a decommissioned 1960s Victoria line carriage resting in the Walthamstow Pumphouse Museum. From Thursday to Saturday every week, it’s home to evenings featuring colorful cuisine from chef Beatriz Maldonado Carreño. Guests can enjoy a seasonally rotating six-course menu of Latin-American inspired cuisine in a vintage, stationary tube car with all of its original features, except that smell. A selection of wine and cocktails is available, so no need to bring your flask.
Rather than a heads-down chamber of indifference that is the functioning tube, the pop-up features mostly communal-style seating, encouraging you to strike up conversation with strangers over the course of the evening. For a few pounds extra you can enjoy a more intimate meal, for those who yearn for a romantic moment on public transportation.
The Supper Club Tube is likely to be the best meal and most interaction you’ve ever had in a London tube."	A decommissioned tube carriage within a London museum hosts a regular pop-up supper club.
