Iguazu Falls	['unesco', 'waterfalls', 'water']	590	518	"Flowing for the most part through Brazil, the Iguazu river breaks into upper and lower portions right on the divide between Brazil and Argentina.
Depending on the water level of the river, there are between 150 and 300 separate waterfalls at the site pouring water over off a drop of 200 to 300 feet. Despite the hundreds of smaller falls that appear and disappear over the cliffs, over half of the river’s output flows through a channel known simply as the Devil’s Throat.
The border between the two countries runs right down the Devil’s Throat separating, the lion’s share of the falls into the Argentinian side and the rest still pouring out of Brazil. There is a scenic overlook that is accessible from the two countries which attracts tourists from both. The Iguazu Falls may divide the river, but they also seem to bring two countries together."	A series of waterfalls so massive they straddle the border of Argentina and Brazil.
