Dunrobin Castle		235	651	"A Castle in the Scottish Highlands that was redesigned in the French Chateau Style in 1845 by the architect, Charles Berry.
The Castle was used as a Naval Hospital during World War I, and a boarding school from 1965 to 1972. It is the most Northerly of Scotlandâ€™s castles and the largest in the Northern Highlands with 189 rooms. It has been continuously inhabited since the 1300s.
After a tour of the castle, be sure to descend into the lush gardens behind the castle. Follow the trails all the way to the Moray of Firth. In the left-hand corner of the gardens, you will be witness to one of the oldest sports in Europe, Falconry. The magnificent birds fly freely from tree to tree and have a special bond with the man who raised them all from hatchlings."
