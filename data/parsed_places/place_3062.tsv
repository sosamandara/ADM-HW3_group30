The Pearl Love Hotel	['haikyo', 'places to stay', 'hotels', 'ruins']	20	417	"The Pearl Love Hotel Haikyo in Tochigi is a wreck in camouflage, deeply nested underneath a blanket of scraggy brown vines.
Rooms lie in embers, grown through with ferns; once-bohemian beds, chaise lounges and chandeliers lie scrapped, dropped, and despoiled with the nests of birds, spiders, and the homeless. The grand two-story executive suite still maintains some of its sordid gravitas, its sultry red round-bedded apex room as faux-regal as ever, now overlooking a graveyard of spent passion inveigled by natureâ€™s rapacious tendrils.
Written by Japanese Haikyo expert and explorer Michael John Grist. More about this place and other Haikyo can be found on his site here."	The ruin of a Japanese love hotel almost completely overgrown with brambles.
