High Point Restaurant (RyeMabee Mansion)	['mansions', 'restaurants']	109	533	"This stately three-level, Tudor style house was constructed in 1929 by Irene Mabee. It has long been believed that the home was once a pit stop for mobster Al Capone as he traveled from Miami to Chicago. The area is considered a highpoint between the two major cities. 
The interior of the home was once equipped with a rooftop escape hatch and tunnels underneath used to transport Capone’s liquor. Local folktales persist to this day about John Dillinger and Capone playing cards on the patio while enjoying a drink. 
In the early 2000’s, the mansion was refurbished and became known as the High Point Restaurant, well-known for its aged steak and fresh seafood."	This mansion turned restaurant was once a pitstop for Al Capone during his travels.
