Wallabies of Inchconnachan	['animal islands', 'lakes', 'islands', 'water', 'animals']	55	470	"A small island in Scotland’s Loch Lomond has a population of unusual residents: feral wallabies. The troupe of marsupials was introduced to Inchconnachan in the 1940s, where they’ve roamed freely since.
The wallabies were brought to the island by Fiona Bryde Colquhoun, later known as Lady Arran. She was a quirky character with a love of exotic animals. Lady Arran once owned a backyard menagerie that included creatures like wallabies, llamas, and pigs. After World War II, she moved her wallabies to her holiday home on Inchconnachan. The eccentric aristocrat was also a celebrated power boater, and earned herself the nickname “the fastest granny on water.”
Unfortunately, the wallabies she loved aren’t viewed in the most favorable light. Many have suggested they should be culled, as the foreign animals—who are native to Australia—supposedly pose a threat to the island’s native capercaillie population. Tourists, however, seem to enjoy heading to Inchconnachan to catch a glimpse of its cute, though out-of-place, inhabitants."	An eccentric aristocrat brought these Australian natives to their current Scottish home.
