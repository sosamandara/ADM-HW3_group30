The Viktor Wynd Museum of Curiosities, Fine Art & Natural History	['purveyors of curiosities', 'museums and collections']	970	4240	"Viktor Wynd’s Little Shop of Horrors, or the Last Tuesday Society shop as it’s more generally known, is a 21st Century take on the classic Victorian cabinet of curiosities, located in East London.
It takes its official name from the “pataphysical” Last Tuesday Society Chancellor, Viktor Wynd. The Society “is devoted to exploring and furthering the esoteric, literary and artistic aspects of life in London and beyond”.
The gallery shop, situated within a small group of commercial premises along an arterial road, is full of taxidermied specimens of all sizes, skeletons under glass domes, erotica, modern art, books and myriad other curios.
Step inside and glimpse everything from polar bears to peacocks, quartz dildos to vintage speculums, winged animals to insect sculptures, skulls of all sizes and origins, anatomical anomalies, and even a couple of mermaids.
The shop’s website describes it as “an attempt to recreate or reinterpret, within 21st century sensibilities, a 17th century Wunderkabinett”.
Although in need of a good dusting, the Last Tuesday Society’s Shop of Horrors is curious, horrific and fascinating in equal measure.
“It is a collection of objects assembled at a whim on the basis of their aesthetic or historical appeal,” the website explains.
“There is no attempt at creating or explaining, meta-narratives or educating anyone. It is merely a display of naturalia and artificialia designed to give pleasure to the creators of the Museum, who hope that you too will enjoy it.”
The shop’s manager, Vadim Kosmos, says: “Curiosity shops provide a sense of wonder. You can look anything up on the internet these days, but you can’t touch it.”
The groundwork is now a dedicated bar selling the usual drinks and cocktails but specializing in absinth served in the traditional manner with fountain, spoon, and sugar"	This shop and gallery is a modern-day cabinet of curiosities, unassumingly positioned along an urban thoroughfare.
