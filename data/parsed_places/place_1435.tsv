Zak Bagans Haunted Museum	['museums']	316	1234	"If you are a fan of the paranormal, then Zak Bagans Haunted Museum is a must-visit when in Las Vegas. The museum is filled with strange, unusual, and even haunted artifacts. It’s not just a building turned ghostly museum, it’s also a historical landmark with its own bit of history to explore. 
In fall 2017, Zak Bagans, of Travel Channel’s Ghost Adventures opened the Haunted Museum in one of Las Vegas’ oldest residences. Constructed in 1938 as a mansion for banker Cyril Wengert and his family, the property most recently housed the Nevada Bar Association. Several weird urban legends have been connected to the home along with rumors of satanic rituals. 
Even if the house was never used for dark rituals before, it is certainly filled with more than its fair share of unsettling relics now. Blending “haunted” objects and historical artifacts, the museum is not for the faint of heart.
An area set up as a funeral parlor includes hand-painted glass windows from the 1800s. Another room is a full circus-themed puppet theatre. 
One room features memorabilia and personal effects related to famous serial killers Charles Manson, John Wayne Gacy, Richard Ramirez, and others. Another allows visitors to peek inside Dr. Kevorkian’s Volkswagon “death van.” There is even an exhibit featuring objects previously owned by former Las Vegas residents and entertainers such as Michael Jackson and Liberace. 
For fans of Bagans’ show, you will see the infamous doll “Peggy,” as well as the original staircase from the Indiana “Demon House,” as well as the Dybbuk box. Visitors may even see Bagans strolling through the museum or gift shop."	A collection of haunted objects and macabre oddities under one roof.
