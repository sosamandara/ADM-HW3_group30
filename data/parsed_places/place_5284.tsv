World's Largest Ball of Twine	['giant spheres', 'spheres', 'monuments']	422	628	"This twine ball isn’t just huge – it’s continually growing. No better way to ensure that it maintains the title of the World’s Largest, of course.
Every August, Cawker city holds the annual twine-a-thon. This is a chance to add your contribution to the world’s largest ball of twine. 
Frank Stober started the ball of twine in 1953. In Just 4 years the ball weighed 5000 lbs and stood eight feet tall.
There is not much in Cawker City but the local businesses get in the spirit with twine-themed artworks in the windows and a painted twine stripe on the sidewalk. However, driving around the area is an experience.  The neighborhood is slightly empty and eerie with odd collections in the residents’ yards and broken-down buildings everywhere. The perfect site for a horror film."	It's big, it's a ball, and it's made of twine--the world's largest of its kind.
