Albany Shoe Tree	['outsider art', 'plants']	98	416	"If there’s one thing small-town folks in Indiana know, it’s not to let something special pass them by. If that thing is a little strange, well, it won’t be for long. Such was the case with the “Shoe Tree” in Albany, Indiana, which started as a quirky tradition for local teenagers, but grew to be embraced by the entire community.
It’s not altogether unusual to see a pair of old shoes tied together and hanging somewhere public - in a tree, on some power lines, or off an overhang. But in Albany, one grew to hundreds, and became a local point of pride.
The actual number of shoes hanging from the Shoe Tree fluctuates, with weather and meddlesome visitors occasionally removing them. But on a warm summer day, it might be worth a stroll to this point of communal history, to see just how many people have chosen to proudly participate."	One tree's homage to soles past and present.
