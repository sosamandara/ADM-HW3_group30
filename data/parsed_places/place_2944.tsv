The structures were created with found materials over a period of 28 years by artist Michael Kahn and his wife Leda Livant.
Eliphante is one of the wackier examples of outsider architecture, and is listed as a part of the Smithsonian’s SOS initiative (Save Outdoor Sculptures). Eliphante been visited by thousands over the years.
Update March, 2018: Eliphante is a private residence and is closed to the public."	Outsider Art Community.
