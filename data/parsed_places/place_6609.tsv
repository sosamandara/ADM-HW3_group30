Ballyhoo Curiosity Shop	['shops', 'collections']	348	1251	"The Ballyhoo Curiosity Shop describes itself as a place that “fits somewhere between a natural history museum and an antique store.” Though it’s a small shop, you could spend hours perusing its oddities and marvels.
The underground shop is void of all windows, but filled with various types of tribal art, designs made from human remains, and a plethora of unique artifacts. The strangeness of its stock is apparent as soon as you enter, as once you step inside the store, you’re greeted by a taxidermy two-headed calf.
Browsing its many curiosities is a captivating way to spend an hour or two. A stuffed raccoon butt hangs on a wall, along with shelves and glass cases filled with marvelous oddities and old antiques of all kinds. And, if you so happen across some human teeth you like, most items (if not all) are for sale."	This Seattle store is packed with all sorts of curious creatures and creations.
