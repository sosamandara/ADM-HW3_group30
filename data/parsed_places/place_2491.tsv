The Faerie Playhouse	"[""valentine's day"", 'activism', 'lgbtq', 'love', 'outsider architecture', 'eccentric homes', 'homes']"	235	1029	"This Creole cottage became the home of Stewart Butler and Alfred Doolittle in 1979 and was the site of many organizing meetings in the LGBT civil rights movement during the late 20th century and early 21st century.
The garden behind the home contains the cremains of many significant leaders in the struggle for equality, including Charlene Schneider, John Ognibene and Cliff Howard, as well as artist J.B. Harter. 
While Alfred passed away several years ago, Stewart still resides in the Faerie Playhouse. The large wooden hearts that adorn the front of the house are said to be a tribute to his life partner, Alfred, who loved Valentine’s Day and all that it meant. 
Update as of April 2020: We regret to inform our community that Mr. Butler passed on March 5, 2020, at the age of 89."	A pink cottage covered in hearts served as a haven and a resting place for LGBTQ activists.
