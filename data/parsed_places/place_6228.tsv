Sweden Solar System	['solar system models', 'marvelous maps and measures', 'small worlds and model towns', 'instruments of science', 'natural history']	235	699	"The Sweden Solar System is the world’s largest model of our planetary system, at a scale of 1:20 million.
The sun is represented by the Globe Arena in Stockholm, the largest spherical building in the world. The planets, all appropriately scaled, are all around Stockholm and its suburbs. Jupiter (diameter 7.3 m) is at the Stockholm-Arlanda International Airport, Saturn is in Uppsala, and Pluto in Delsbo, 300 km from the Globe Arena. At each planet, a small exhibit provides information about astronomy and the mythological figure after whom each planet is named.
Even a few non-planets are represented in the Swedish solar system. Sedna, a trans-Neptunian object, can be found 912 km from the Globe Arena in the “Technical House” in Luleå."
