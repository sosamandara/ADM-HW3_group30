This quaint sweets shop in Harpers Ferry claims to be the nation’s only research-based historic candy store, selling nostalgia-inducing and forgotten bites from the past.
The expertly curated offerings at True Treats are presented in chronological order, allowing visitors to take a journey through time while sating that sweet tooth. Start with early examples such as ancient Greek chewing gum and Iroquois hickory bark before fast-forwarding to the heyday of candied flowers in the 17th and 18th centuries. Then taste the flavors that came courtesy of the Industrial Revolution, which welcomed mass-produced taffies, truffles, and peanut brittle (the store’s offering for the latter comes from George Washington Carver’s recipe). Finish with the 20th century, and the rise of modern classics such as bubble gum, candy bars, and gummy candies.
For its commitment to celebrating the longevity of humanity’s relationship with candy, the store was rated as the number-one confectionery store in West Virginia by the Food Network. True Treats proves that sweet never goes out of style."	Time travel with sweets across history at this research-based candy store.
