KGB Muzeum	['secret police', 'kgb', 'museums and collections', 'museums']	261	705	"Located in a small Prague storefront is the KGB Muzeum, a show space for one man’s collection of artifacts, uniforms, and weaponry from Russia’s much-feared secret service of yore. And for no extra charge you will get the owner’s strange enthusiasm for the subject as well. 
There are a number of KGB museums around Europe, usually based out of a location the secret organization used for one purpose or another. But the museum in Prague seems to simply be the owner’s personal obsession. The exhibit holds an impressive number of items including spy cameras, bizarre Soviet uniforms, weapons of all kinds, and even a Vladimir Lenin death mask. There are photos, typewriters, phones, patches, badges, and all sorts of other small ephemera littering the shelves. 
A visit to the museum costs a small fee, but will get you a personal tour of the museum by its very enthusiastic and eccentric Russian owner. According to many of the Trip Advisor reviews, the curator has a strangely accepting attitude towards the KGB’s role in history, and not everyone seems happy about it. However he responds directly to any negative reviews, so take that as you will.
Nonetheless, Prague’s KGB Muzeum is definitely an experience. If you visit, be prepared to pose for pictures holding large guns and wearing Russian army hats."	One man's personal collection of KGB memorabilia is presented along with his strange viewpoint.
