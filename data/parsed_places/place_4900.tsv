TNT Area	['superfund site', 'cryptozoology', 'monsters', 'bunkers', 'weapons', 'disaster areas', 'subterranean', 'subterranean sites', 'world war ii', 'military']	285	760	"For a brief period in late 1966 and early 1967, the West Virginia Ordnance Works, better known to locals as the TNT Area, was home to one of the United States’ most famous mythical creatures: the Mothman.
This curious cryptid was first seen at the gate of the abandoned munitions storage facility. Reported sightings in the area continued until the collapse of the Silver Bridge in December of 1967.
The Mothman and the circumstances around its mysterious appearance in Point Pleasant would later be chronicled in John Keel’s 1976 book The Mothman Prophecies and its 2002 movie adaptation.
While there seems to be no established theory explaining the mass sightings, nor a theory as to why the creature would choose the TNT Area as its home, the rows of World War II-era igloo-like bunkers and dilapidated laboratories give it all the ambiance a discerning monster could want. The TNT Area became a Superfund site in 1983 and is still undergoing cleanup and decontamination."	These rows of World War II-era bunkers were the scene of some of the infamous Mothman sightings.
