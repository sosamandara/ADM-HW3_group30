Nike Park	['missiles', 'cold war', 'military history', 'parks', 'abandoned', 'military']	133	556	"During the Cold War, the American government began constructing missile launch sites all over the country, never dreaming that they would one day be shut down and converted into public parks, as in the case of Illinois’ Nike Park.  
Once part of a larger Nike Missile complex (Nike C-72), the Nike Park land was given over to the Addison Park District after the missiles, launchers, and most of the equipment was removed, and the site decommissioned. Unfortunately, no evidence of the launch site exists any longer, as it now part of the Fullerton County Forest Preserve. The radar installation and control tower located on the northwest end of the base, however, still stand in what is now Nike Park, surrounded by baseball diamonds, tennis courts, and a playground. 
While all of the munitions have been removed from the site, one of the decomissioned missiles is still on display in nearby Villa Park, Illinois, in front of the town’s VFW hall.
Most public parks take safety very seriously, but this may be the only park that was once equipped to respond to an international war."
