Dahlem-Dorf U-Bahn Station Benches	['trains']	270	523	"A row of sexy benches at Berlin’s Dahlem-Dorf U-Bahn station invite people to take a seat—although the experience is more about excitement than comfort.
Designed by local artist Wolf van Roy the benches resemble some African fetish statues. The Dahlem area itself is more traditional by architectural style and the station building was built in 1913. Hardly anyone would imagine then that this traditional farmhouse-looking building would receive this kind of addition."	A traditional U-Bahn station in Berlin gets a string of rather untraditional benches.
