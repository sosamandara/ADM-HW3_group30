Kasha-Katuwe means white cliffs in Keresan, and this area of white tent-shaped rock formations gained the status of being a national monument named Tent Rocks in January of 2001. 
The area is open for exploration only during the daytime, and even then it can be closed by the local Cochiti Pueblo Tribal Governor’s will. There is a recreation trail that winds visitors up to an observation point for a full view of the gorgeous rocks from above.
The rocks’ sharp tips that widen into conical-shaped bases, which gives them the distinct appearance of a teepee. The monument is a little isolated but it is not too hard to find. The area also offers a good opportunity to view the life and history of native people along with the natural majesty of the stone mountains. The monument is a unit of the BLM’s National Landscape Conservation System."	A unique geological area spiked with wind-carved rocks that resemble teepees.
