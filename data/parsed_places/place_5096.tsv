Singapore's Rooftop Pool	['places to stay', 'Unique Restaurants & Bars', 'water']	459	466	"The Singapore skyline boasts the largest swimming pool of any other skyline in the world. The massive pool sits on the 57th floor, above the three 55-story high hotel towers of the Marina Bay Sands Resort, an integrated resort property whose construction project was the most expensive of its kind.
The design, conceptualized by the resort’s architect Moshe Safdie, was inspired by a deck of playing cards, appropriate, as one of the hotel’s main attractions is its large casino. The pool’s vanishing edge gives the appearance of an abrupt cut-off at 650 feet in the air; however, just below the top edge is another trough-like basin which catches the water and returns it to the main pool.
Measuring 478 feet long, almost three Olympic swimming pools in length, the SkyPark pool is the world’s largest infinity-edge pool at that height. There is also a restaurant, bar, spa, and botanical garden with 250 species of trees and 650 plants, and an observation deck which costs 23 SGD (or around 18 USD) to enjoy."	The largest pool at its elevation sits on top of one of the most expensive resorts in the world.
