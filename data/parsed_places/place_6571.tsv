David Adickes Studio	['artists', 'gallery', 'sculptures', 'statues']	402	518	"David Adickes is known for the large statues he sculpts. He sculpted a 67-foot replica of Sam Houston for the city of Huntsville, Texas. In Lead, South Dakota, Adickes created 43 enormous busts of each American president for display at an educational museum.
His workshop in Houston is open to the public and features many of his most outstanding works. Not intended to be a destination, the workshop/gallery has turned into a destination, an often-surprising site where one can see something out of the ordinary in the middle of an industrial part of the city.
Giant heads will occasionally sit in the parking lot and huge sculptures of the Beatles and former President Bush can be seen from the street. Occasionally one will find Adickes working in the shop, with his six employees, slowly crafting ever more extravagant work."	Giant heads occasionally litter the industrial Houston neighborhood where sculptor David Adickes has his studio.
