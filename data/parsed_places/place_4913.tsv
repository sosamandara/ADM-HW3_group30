Din Lligwy	['villages', 'ruins']	71	418	"One of the many wonders on the Isle of Anglesey, Din Lligwy is a well-preserved set of stone-built huts in an enclosure dating from the Roman-British period. It is an excellent example of a fortified hut group.
It is currently in a wooded grove of trees, lending it an otherworldly feel. At the time when people would have lived in the settlement, the trees that currently stand would not have been there, providing the inhabitants a clear view of the bay. The site covers about a half an acre, and includes the foundations of various buildings.
The people who lived here would have been local Britons. They would have lived in roundhouses but otherwise adopted much of their lifestyle from the invading Romans. Excavation at the beginning of the 20th century revealed coins and other artifacts from the 3rd and 4th centuries, though there is evidence that the huts were in use even before that time.
There are a variety of buildings, including roundhouses and rectangular barns. The site also includes smelting hearths and iron slag suggesting that the site was used for metalworking. It is within easy walking distance to other sites that show the neolithic era (the Lligwy tomb) and the medieval period (Hen Capel Lligwy) of Anglesey.
The site is off in a field accessible only via a small road. but even if it is a bit off the beaten path, the site provides an impressive view into the area’s past."	These haunting ruins belong to an ancient village that once had one hell of a view.
