Machrie Moor Standing Stones	['standing stones', 'intriguing environs', 'islands', 'archaeology', 'ecosystems']	119	703	"In the age of Outlander, standing stones have a larger fan base than ever before. But what are standing stones? Those at Machrie on Scotland’s Isle of Arran prove it matters little what they are and far more that they have the power to imbue magic and wonder into even the most ordinary of landscapes.
On this picturesque island, the ancient standing stones on Arran have their own special draw. There are no less than six circles at Machrie, built over a period of hundreds of years at least. The archeologically inclined will discover stone circles, standing stones, cairns and hut circles; remains of which have been dated to as early as 3500 B.C. 
Not far from crashing waves but inland enough to be hidden from the major road, the entire site is scattered between crumbling farm houses, twisted trees, and sweeping areas of windswept grasses long enough to conceal anyone who might desire a romp in the heather.
Outlander fans would be forgiven for dreaming of just such an activity with any nearby Scot. You won’t find a hill such as the one in the television show, but the same wondrous spirit seems to be waiting as you touch one stone and then another, worn with time and covered in lichen. Golden hour and sunset light only serve to heighten the sense of fantasy. 
The Isle of Arran itself already has a certain romance to it, known across the country as “Scotland in Miniature” because it has all the elements that make the country great, all heaped together on a pile of rock less than 20 miles long and 10 miles wide. Add frequent rain showers and plentiful rainbows to the mix and it’s simply incredible the island isn’t more popular as a tourist destination."	More stones than Stonehenge, all scattered within a windswept landscape sure to enchant 'Outlander' fans.
