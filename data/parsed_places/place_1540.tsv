Bigar Waterfall	['waterfalls', 'natural wonders', 'water', 'nature']	119	1098	"TIn Caras-Severin County in the western part of Romania, the amazing Bigar Waterfall is so lovely it is even called “the miracle from the Minis Canyon” by the locals.
Located in the Anina Mountains on the Mini River, the rounded waterfall is almost eight meters high, and falls over an unusual and dramatic green carpet of moss. Unlike more roaring falls, this waterwork flows over the apex of a fat, rounded stone, and is diverted into a sheet of countless small streams that issue from the bottom of the stone which juts out over the basin below.
The otherworldly beauty of the site even earned it a place as the number one interesting waterfall in Romania.
Update as of June 2021: The waterfall collapsed in part from natural causes."	Moss and stone turn this waterfall into an otherworldly liquid veil.
