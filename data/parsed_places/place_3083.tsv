Maxie, the World's Largest Goose	['giant animals', 'giant', 'birds', 'statues', 'animals']	94	456	"Standing in the middle of a public park, caught in mid-flight is a monstrously large goose known as Maxie, the mascot of the so-called wild goose capital of the world.
This giant bird was first installed back in 1976 and even though she is made of fiberglass, she actually flew into her current spot with the help of a helicopter. Even at 4,000 pounds, she takes flight a bit when the wind is strong enough, turning ever so slightly. The giant bird stands on a tall cinderblock stand on skinny little legs that belay the true weight of the fake beast.
Sumner sits along a migration path that sees a large number (around 100,000) of wild geese land in the local lakes each year, attracting a number of hunters. This has earned the town its fowl nickname, along with the goose-themed festival which has been held there since 1955. There is no mistaking the townâ€™s claim to fame thanks to a general theme of geese, of which Maxie is clearly the crown jewel.
Visitors to the giant statue are welcome to try and touch the wingtips but may be hard-pressed to reach them, given that they hover a bunch of feet in the air, measuring in at around 65-feet in length. Luckily, even at its massive size, the bird comes off as more majestic than monstrous."	"This 40-foot fowl marks the so-called ""wild goose capital of the world."""
