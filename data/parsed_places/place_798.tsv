North Shore Dance Paving Stones	['dancing', 'plaques']	400	461	"If you visit Chattanooga, Tennesee, take the trolley (or walk over the bridge) to the North Shore. There, all along Frazier Street, you’ll find dance steps embedded in the pavement. From the Merengue to the Waltz, there’s something for everyone. 
The artwork actually teaches visitors how to dance! Follow the numbers, and you’ll be dancing the appropriate steps. If you have some time on your hands, you can even dance your way down one side of the road and up the other."	Follow the steps, and this roadside artwork will teach you how to dance.
