Cassadaga	['paranormal', 'occult', 'sacred spaces']	729	1574	"The Cassadaga Spiritualist Camp in Florida was founded by the medium George Colby in 1875 with help from the members of Lily Dale, the spiritualist community in New York.
Originally part of 145 acres granted to Colby in a homestead grant, the site consists of about 57 acres and 55 homes, expanded from the original 35 acres deeded in 1895 to the town’s residents.
Colby was inspired to found the community by a vision he received in a seance in Iowa, channeled from his Native American spirit guide, whom he called “Seneca”.
Today the town’s residents are spiritualists and mediums opening their homes (closed on Sundays) for such things as seances and palm reading. They have their own Sunday Service open to the public, with a healing service first. They also have a bookstore where you can spend hours reading up on arcane topics or browse from a vast selection of tapes/CDs, crystals, stones, jewelry, Native American crafts and other unique gift items.
Cassadega was named a Historic District on the National Register Of Historic Places in 1991.
Spirit tours and nighttime “orb photography tours” are available for those so inclined."	Town of spiritualists and mediums in Florida.
