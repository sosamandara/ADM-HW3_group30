'Out of Order'	['design', 'outsider art', 'art']	154	575	"A stroll through the historic town of Kingston upon Thames, now part of London, may lead curious visitors to a dozen phone boxes leaning against one another like a set of dominoes. 
This art installation is known as “Out of Order” by David Mach and was installed in 1989. While it’s not quite as iconic as its inspiration, the red telephone box designed by Giles Gilbert Scott, this public art installation has since become one of Kingston’s most iconic landmarks, amusing locals and tourists alike.
Over the years, these disused phone boxes were reportedly infested with rats and trash until they were restored. To celebrate its 30th anniversary, “Out of Order” was repainted, refurbished, and restored to its erstwhile glory, rarely failing to amuse onlookers."	A domino effect created with Britain’s iconic telephone boxes.
