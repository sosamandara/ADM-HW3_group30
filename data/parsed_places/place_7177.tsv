reCARstruction	['cars', 'sculptures', 'art', 'museums']	182	437	"Spotting an old Jeep isn’t usually a sight that’ll stop you in your tracks. But finding an old Jeep crushed and smushed into a large ball? Well, that’s different.
This unique sculpture, called reCARstruction, is an enormous orb created from bits of a 1983 Jeep Grand Wagoneer. It looks like some giant being took the car in its hand and squeezed tight, much like how someone would crumple a piece of paper.
The car was completely dissected, then rearranged to take the shape of a nine-foot-diameter ball. The vehicle, which no doubt once carted people across various distances, is now a hollow shell. Its motor housings, rockers, and gears were all flipped inside-out so they’d appear on the sculpture’s surface.
The odd artwork was created by artist Keny Marshal in 2009. He installed it near the side of the parking lot adjacent to the Pittsburgh Children’s Museum, which owns the piece."
