Patsy Cline Crash Site Memorial	['crash site', 'disasters', 'memento mori', 'graves', 'gravestones', 'music', 'monuments']	144	635	"Beloved country singer Patsy Cline died on March 5, 1963 when the airplane she was riding in plummeted into the Tennessee wilderness, and the crash site is now remembered by a meditative boulder.
Along with fellow country musicians Cowboy Copas, Hawkshaw Hawkins, and Randy Hughes, Cline perished en route to Nashville after recently having described feeling a sense of impending doom. The site, located deep in the middle of the woods, is now marked with a cement plateau which culminates in an installed boulder with the names of the crash victims etched into the top. There is also a small gazebo with an informational collage about the singer. What the site lacks in grandeur it makes up for in an atmosphere of quiet reflection."	An engraved boulder marks the spot where Patsy Cline's life ended in a plane crash.
