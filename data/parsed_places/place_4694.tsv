The Magic House	['strange science', 'museums and collections']	985	469	"You don’t have to be a kid to appreciate all the wonder and knowledge that is packed inside the walls of St. Louis’ Magic House. Once an abandoned Victorian mansion in the Kirkwood suburb, the Magic House now stands as the region’s first interactive children’s museum, which is complete with a news studio simulator and an electrically charged ball that causes visitors’ hair to stand on end. 
It takes more than one day to fully explore and enjoy the scholastic treasures found on every floor of the Magic House. Exhibitions such as the Bubble Room and the Lewis and Clark Adventure are designed to educate and entertain people of all ages. The pin point wall allows curious onlookers to create 3D impressions of themselves, and the Jack and the Beanstalk area gives kids the opportunity to climb a three-story beanstalk just like the hero from the classic children’s tale.
Founded by Jody Newman and Barbie Freund, The Magic House is a not-for-profit organization that originally opened to the public on October 16, 1979 to provide students of all ages with hands-on learning. The house itself was originally built in 1901 and served as a private home for George Lane Edwards, who was the first president of the St. Louis Stock Exchange and one of the directors of the 1904 St. Louis World’s Fair."	The Magic House provides a beautiful and creative environment for curious youngsters to get their knowledge on.
