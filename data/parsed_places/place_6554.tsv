The Roald Dahl Museum	['literature', 'museums and collections', 'museums']	122	541	"Renowned children’s author and occasional spy, Roald Dahl spent the last years of his life in a home located in the small English village of Great Missenden, and now his beloved village is home to an attractive museum devoted to his life and works. 
Author of such all time classics as Matilda, The Witches, The BFG, James and the Giant Peach, and of course Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and its trippy sequel, Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator, Roald Dahl may be one of the most influential authors of all time to a certain generation. In addition to his unrivaled gift for sensitive whimsy as a writer, Dahl also served in the Royal Air Force during World War II, and acted as a spy and raconteur while living in America. Unfortunately he died from a blood disease in 1990. 
After his death, Dahl’s widow Felicity set about finding a suitable place to house and display Dahl’s manuscripts and other effects. She purchased some buildings on Great Missenden’s main street and after a few years gaining funding and working out the details, established the Roald Dahl Museum.
Today the museum holds all of Dahl’s original manuscripts, as well as his “Idea Books” where he would jot down his nascent creations. In addition to celebrating his writing career, there are also displays covering his service in the RAF. However, the crown jewel of the museum is the recreation of Dahl’s purpose built “Writing Hut,” complete with the arm chair he had customized to write in.
The well designed museum is also decorated with numerous illustrations by Dahl’s frequent collaborator, Quentin Blake. The Roald Dahl Museum is a fine, and fun tribute to man whose work continues to bring wonder and imagination to untold generations of readers."	This magical museum celebrates the life and work of a seminal children's book writer (and occasional spy).
