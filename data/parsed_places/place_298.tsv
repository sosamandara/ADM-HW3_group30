Braswell Mountain Rail Tunnel	['trails', 'tunnels', 'railroads', 'transportation', 'subterranean sites', 'abandoned']	115	791	"A previously abandoned 19th-century railroad tunnel hides near Brushy Mountain Road, completely abandoned.
The tunnel was opened in 1882 on a now-shuttered section of the Southern Railway (formerly the East Tennessee, Virginia, and Georgia Railroad) near Braswell, Georgia. After nearly a century of use, it was abandoned in 1980 when the railroad was rerouted.
It’s still possible to venture inside the dark, cavernous space. Its brick interior contains little enclaves, meant to save any pedestrians caught inside while a train thundered through. The roof is stained black, tainted from years of the trains’ coal-fired soot that saturated the air.
The place is almost eerie and spooky. Many rumors and ghost stories abound regarding things that have happened here over the years."	An abandoned railroad tunnel forgotten by time awaits inquisitive hikers.
