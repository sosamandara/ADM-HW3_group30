Seacrest Wolf Preserve	['wolves', 'natural wonders', 'nature', 'animals']	166	1608	"A non-profit founded by a husband and wife team in 1999, the Seacrest Wolf Preserve is the only such preserve in the Southeastern United States. Cynthia and Wayne Watkins own a 400-acre rural farm near Chipley, Florida, and within its confines maintain distinct wolf packs in large fenced tracts.
The wolves being cared for on the preserve are predominantly large gray (timber) wolves and Arctic wolves from both the United States and Canada. These wolves are displaced captive animals who faced death without locations such as this.
Along with the wolves, visitors are encouraged to interact with other small animals being cared for at Seacrest. These include arctic foxes, gray foxes, native skunks, and raccoons. Educational efforts are aimed at informing the public about the importance of maintaining healthy wolf populations in the wild.
Visitors to the preserve are welcome to come and interact with the wolf packs during a two-and-half-hour tour. There are strict rules regarding clothing and photography that are in place to protect the animals. These include the requirement for visitors to wear long pants and no open-toed shoes, and only disposable cameras are allowed in the wolvesâ€™ pens.
This is one of the few places in the world where individuals have the opportunity to touch a gray wolf or fox and learn more about these wonderful creatures."
