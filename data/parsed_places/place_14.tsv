Snösätra Wall of Fame	['walls', 'graffiti', 'outsider art', 'art']	152	546	"The run-down industrial area of Snösätra in the southern suburbs of Stockholm seemed like it was forgotten long ago. That is, until 2014, when it was transformed into one of Europe’s largest graffiti exhibitions.
Practically every sliver of the walls along the streets running through the neighborhood is covered by graffiti. Eye-catching images of people, animals, and objects adorn whatever space is available.
The paintings are done by different street artists from around the world, transforming Snösätra into a canvas that displays a mishmash of different graffiti styles and themes. The owners of the buildings are perfectly willing to let the artists cover the walls with their work.
Every spring, more than 150 graffiti artists from Sweden and beyond descend upon the neighborhood to create new pieces as part of an annual street art festival. The festival includes music, a graffiti battle, and even a virtual reality portion that lets revelers attempt to show off their street art skills within a virtual world. There’s also a wall that’s open to the public to paint, as long as people stick to the rules posted.
Unfortunately, the future of Snösätra is uncertain, as there are plans to turn it into a residential area. As of yet, it’s still a refuge for graffiti lovers, far from the beaten path.
Update as of July 2021: The southern part of Snösätra has been torn down and will be turned into a nature reserve. However, the northern part is still there, covered in graffiti for you to enjoy."	Street artists transformed this abandoned industrial neighborhood into one of Europe's largest graffiti exhibitions.
