The library is free to visit, though the stacks are closed, and open for research to both Masons and non-Masons alike. The collection of over 60,000 volumes includes those on Masonic history, origins, philosophy, symbolism, esoterica, occultism, and hermetic materials. Special collections include the Charles Looney Engraving Collection, African-American Masonic Materials, (the infamous) Morgan Affair Papers, and Rare Scottish Rite Papers.
The Library also displays rotating exhibits in the Reading Room of Masonic Memorabilia and Ephemera featuring materials related to Masonic symbolism, history, and noted Masons. Works on display are drawn from the library’s extensive collection which includes engravings, paintings, ceramics, ritual artifacts, jewelry, furniture, aprons, and other collections gathered by Past Grand Masters of New York.
The Livingston Masonic Library also maintains a branch located in Utica, NY."	A good place to research the Freemasons, esoterica, occultism, and hermeticism.
