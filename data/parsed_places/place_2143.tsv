The Washhouse	['speakeasies', 'bars', 'hidden']	140	832	"People passing by the Washhouse in Manchester, England could be forgiven for thinking the spot is really just as it seems. From the outside, the Washhouse appears to be a humble laundromat. In fact, it is something considerably more fun.
Behind the seemingly normal facade lies a hidden bar. Inside you’ll find a mysterious phone, and one washing machine that’s a bit more door-like than machine-like.
Visitors hoping to stop in for a drink need to call ahead to book a washing machine, and when arriving, hit the button on that mystery phone, and let the voice on the other end know you’re here to do a load. The rest will take care of itself."	This Manchester laundromat is hiding something.
