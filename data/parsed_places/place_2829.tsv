Beechview-Seldom Seen Greenway	['graffiti', 'trails', 'tunnels', 'railroads', 'hidden', 'subterranean sites', 'parks']	192	805	"Once a small farming village, Beechview-Seldom Seen Greenway is now a hidden nature area dedicated to preserving some of Pittsburgh’s natural scenery. Its acres of green space let intrepid explorers feel like they’ve slipped into a slice of nature far away from the city.
The pathway itself is not long, but it features some pretty cool off-the-beaten-path hangout spots. The main attraction is the abandoned graffitied railroad overpass, which now serves as an unsanctioned canvas for vibrant art.
It’s also not uncommon to see people rock climbing and slacklining along the dilapidated tunnel marking the trail entrance. The tunnel is worth stopping to check out. It was built in the early 1900s using alternating layers of bricks that form a striking pattern to walk beneath.
There is a rocky-beach area running along the creek that some people like to swim in on hot days. When the water level is low, you can follow the creek’s path for quite a while. One way leads further into the woods past where the path stops, while the other way heads toward a cavernous area near the tunnel."	This secluded walking trail is a hidden gem of a Pittsburgh park.
