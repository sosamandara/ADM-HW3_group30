Hidden Treasures	['outsider architecture', 'shops', 'outsider art']	212	1113	"Tucked away in California’s Topanga Canyon, Hidden Treasures is a vintage and antique store that is seemingly more interested in creating a bizarre atmosphere than creating sales. 
The shop is housed in what looks like a demented pirate’s disco ghost ship. On the widow’s walk, a zombie ship captain is made to look like he’s steering the house. Beneath that, the store name is spelled out in brilliant, glittering letters. And then, of course, there are the skulls hanging from the rafters. The eccentric shop looks more like a haunted house than a place to pick up vintage dresses and antique knick-knacks. 
Hidden Treasures is, in part, a standard vintage shop (albeit an extraordinarily well-curated one) with clothing dating from Victorian times right up to the 1980’s and everything in between. The racks are covered in a surreal mix of western shirts, psychedelic polyester, and intentionally ugly scarves. Mixed among the clothing, hats, and shoes are devil statues, anatomical models, religious iconography, and bizarrely-dressed mannequins, some for sale, some not. Shopping the store is akin to an LSD trip through an overstimulated mind. 
Owner Darell Hazin changes out the wares seasonally, but the one thing that remains the same is the strict devotional dadaist spectacle."	An unreal vintage shop that wears its dadaist influence on its zombie fish.	['/places/great-wall-of-topanga', '/places/theatricum-botanicum', '/places/self-realization-fellowship-lake-shrine']	154 S.
