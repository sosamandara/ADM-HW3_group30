Applecross Pass	['livestock', 'roads', 'intriguing environs', 'ecosystems']	232	625	"This route winds through stunning Scottish scenery. Crags blanketed in grass loom on either side like daunting roadside guardians. With its sharp curves and coils, it almost looks like a giant asphalt snake slithering through the Highlands.
This five-mile (nine-kilometer) road became part of the scenic North Coast 500 route when it was launched in 2015, which has greatly increased the traffic levels on the pass. However, this single winding track has been around a lot longer.
It was originally a droveway, a track used to move livestock from one place to another. Its Gaelic name is Bealach na Bà, (pronounced byee-alluch nuh bah), which means “pass of the cattle”. It was the only access in and out of Applecross until 1975.
The road is beloved of cyclists keen to test their legs. It has the steepest ascent of any road in the United Kingdom, starting from sea level and rising to 2,054 feet (626 meters). Its challenging hairpin bends are a magnet for bikers and its outstanding views over to the Isle of Skye and magnificent topography delight tourists and locals alike. However, it is not for the faint-hearted."	This single-track road rewards brave drivers with stunning Scottish scenery.
