Mice Manor	['horror', 'crafts', 'miniatures', 'taxidermy', 'shops', 'animals', 'art']	39	499	"About five minutes away from the hustle and bustle of Salem is a quiet little studio known as Local Artisan. At first glance, it may seem like any other quirky gift shop, until you take the time to peruse the space a bit. Full of taxidermy, oddities, and unique art, there is a little something for everyone. The shining star of the entire collection is a black dollhouse called Mice Manor.
Mice Manor is the brainchild of Cassandra Carr, the owner of Local Artisan. Cassandra, a self-taught taxidermist, artist, and Mothman enthusiast, handcrafted each rodent that inhabits the manor. Mice Manor even has its own detailed history, which is inscribed on a plaque on its exterior: 
Built for Captain Thibault Nibbles / Shipmaster and Merchant, / And his Wife Violet Nibbles, / 1771 - Historic Beverly
The occupants of Mice Manor are no ordinary tenants and change periodically since every one of them is available for sale. Currently, the manor is the residence of Buffalo Bill, the infamous serial killer from Silence of the Lambs. Dressed in a kimono, he has a basket nearby with a teeny, tiny bottle of lotion inside. In another room resides none other than Norman Bates dressed as his mother. Perhaps the most formidable of all of the rodent occupants, Lizzie Borden, is in yet another room brandishing an ax. In the near future, Jack Torrance from The Shining will be renting a room in Mice Manor, complete with his own tiny typewriter."	A dollhouse full of taxidermy rodents, each one handcrafted and given a sordid past.
