Gravity Hill	['gravity hill', 'optical illusions', 'mystery spots and gravity hills', 'optical oddities', 'physics', 'strange science', 'mystery']	143	1233	"On a lonely stretch of road north of Prosser, Washington, at the “base” of a small incline, if you shift your car into neutral you will, as if by magic, begin rolling uphill. 
The reasons given for this strange occurrence range all across the paranormal spectrum, from aliens to ghosts. In fact, the phenomenon is actually an optical illusion, known as a “magnetic hill,” “anti-gravity hill” or simply “gravity hill.”
In these “mystery spots”—located all over the world—what appears to be an uphill incline is actually part of a larger downhill incline, misinterpreted by our brains because of the way the slopes are situated mixed with little or no view of the horizon line. So it looks as if objects are defying gravity, a natural illusion that’s been tricking and wowing onlookers at these curious spots for centuries.
Finding Washington’s Gravity Hill is no easy feat, but you’ll know for sure when you’ve found it—some lover of the strange was kind enough to paint a starting line."	"The strange phenomenon causing gravity to ""work backwards"" on this hill has been blamed on the paranormal."
