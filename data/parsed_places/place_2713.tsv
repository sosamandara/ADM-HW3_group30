Devil's Den	['natural springs', 'natural wonders', 'water', 'nature']	413	2154	"Devil’s Den is a karst window, in which the roof over a subterranean river has collapsed, exposing the water to the open surface. Located near Williston, Florida, it is privately owned and operated as a scuba diving training and recreational facility.
The pleasant year-around air temperature of 72 degrees allows comfortable diving, winter or summer. On cold winter mornings you can see steam, like smoke, rising from the cave’s chimney—the reason that early settlers called the place Devil’s Den."	The scuba diving training facility was named for the steam that rises from the cave's chimney.
