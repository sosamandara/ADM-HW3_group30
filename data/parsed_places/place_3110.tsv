Caffe Vittoria	['restaurants', 'shops', 'collections']	936	1892	"The sheen of shiny silver and copper metal is the first thing you notice when you step into Caffe Vittoria.
The cafe displays dozens of vintage espresso machines and coffee makers, along with other types of coffee mugs and posters. They make a killer espresso, martini, or fresh cannoli. The shop opened in 1929 and has been packed with happy customers ever since - come in and test your knowledge of antique brew technology."	The oldest Italian caf√© in Boston, this spot also serves as a veritable museum of vintage coffee ephemera.
