In the late 1800s Bled Island and village, located in the middle of glacial Lake Bled, were seen as a health resort by aristocrats from around the world. Today the island and the Assumption of Mary Pilgrimage Church are known to be major tourist attractions. Bled Castle is an iconic landmark because of its location teetering on a cliff overlooking the lake.
The Assumption of Mary Pilgrimage Church was built in the 15th century and is known by visitors because of the 99 steps that lead up to the church. Traditionally, local grooms carry their brides up these steps while the bride remains perfectly silent, in order to bring them happiness in the future. The church also has bells that visitors ring for good luck. Tourists can hire boats to get to the church.Â 
Bled is famous for a dessert called the Bled Cream Cake which can be purchased at many of the cafes and restaurants in Bled."	This one-time health resort was used by aristocrats around the world.
