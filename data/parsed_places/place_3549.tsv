Monster Kabinett	['amazing automata', 'monsters', 'strange science', 'outsider art', 'collections', 'museums and collections']	908	3374	"The Monster Kabinett is a wonderland (so to speak) of massive robotic creatures, clanking metal sculptures and insect-like beasts.
In short, it lives up to its unsettling name.
Created and maintained by an art collective known as the Dead Pigeon Collective, the Monster Kabinett is a warehouse full of strange art and costumed revelers, all waiting to put on a show each Thursday and Friday night. Good luck trying to figure out which creations are human and which are simply moving metal masterpieces.
Visitors are confronted with the stuff of nightmares, from skittering arachnoid robots to leering, malformed sculptures to aggressive actors straight out of a haunted house. Except this haunting is year-round.
The journey to the Monster Kabinett is a fitting one as well, down a dank alley off of a bustling city street. Most patrons are unsure of whether they’ve reached the right location until they’re directly in front of it, often greeted by a good-natured but somewhat off-key member of the collective.
The gallery is safe, of course, but built to instill and inspire as much fright and dread as possible. And rest assured, the Dead Pigeon Collective does that part very well. The Monster Kabinett better seen than heard, which is why their website is built as more of a tour than a repository of dry information.
And really, what information about the gallery is necessary? It’s best left a mystery until you experience it first-hand.
Update June 2018: The museum/collection is open Wednesdays through Saturdays with hourly tours."	Part art gallery, part haunted house, this robotic art display is a terrifying experience.
