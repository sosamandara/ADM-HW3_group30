Formerly the home of the Shoshone and Tataviam peoples, the 932-acre site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, and is maintained today by the County of Los Angeles Department of Parks and Recreation.
Over the years, these rocks have been a favorite film site for Hollywood, appearing in numerous films and TV shows such as Planet of the Dinosaurs, Star Trek, and The Flintstones. They were named after the bandit Tiburcio Vasquez."	Named after a bandit and the star of several Hollywood prehistoric landscapes, these sandstone formations are a historical part of the Los Angeles natural landscape.
