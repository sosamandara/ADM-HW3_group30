International Rock-A-Billy Hall of Fame	['collections']	96	416	"In the middle of Tennessee (between Memphis and Nashville), Jackson hosts the International Rock-A-Billy Hall of Fame and Museum, opened in 2000 by dedicated fan Henry Harrison. For those who aren’t familiar with Rock-a-Billy, it’s the accidental brainchild of rock’n’roll and hillbilly music, mainly exported from Tennessee. The genre gained national recognition in the 1950s through the fame of Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly, and other acts.
The International Rock-a-Billy Hall of Fame offers a wide variety of attractions, including a unique collection of historical videos (such as a Johnny Cash PSA dedicated to war veterans), 14 life-size oil portraits of your favorite Rock-a-Billy superstars, and the Rock-a-Billy Rockers Dance Team (whom you can take line dance lessons with every Monday night!). There is even a 28’x70’ mural that visually depicts the beginning and expansion of Rock-a-Billy music around the world.
The museum also hosts an annual Rock-A-Billy Festival when it inducts new honorees into the Hall of Fame, as well as live music every Friday night.
The International Rock-A-Billy Hall of Fame is not to be confused with the Rock-A-Billy Hall of Fame, which is an online Hall of Fame, not a real place."
