The Haunted Bookshop	['occult', 'bookstores', 'repositories of knowledge']	228	846	"The creepy Haunted Bookshop in Melbourne is loaded with the occult and obscure. Books include such eclectic topics as Magic, Aleister Crowley, Witchcraft, Satanism, Anton LaVey, Divination, Tarot, Ghosts, Vampires & Aliens.
Though devoted to dark antiquarian arts the shop still needs to get the word out. According to its myspace page “Only out of the womb of darkness is born the light of knowledge …”
The book store has been giving ghost tours for 20 years, exploring dark lanes and spooky sites while discovering dark secrets behind the cultural capital of Melbourne. Each tour is personally conducted by Haunted Bookshop owner and Foxtel’s Haunted Australia TV presenter Drew Sinton who has been researching Australia’s ghosts for over 30 years and is a proud recipient of a Melbourne Lord Mayor’s commendation."
