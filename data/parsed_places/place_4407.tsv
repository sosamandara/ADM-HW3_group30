Musical Legends Park	['music', 'parks']	1401	778	"This small park on Bourbon Street is dedicated to the rich cultural and musical heritage of New Orleans. Throughout, you’ll find life-size bronze statues of local musicians such as Al Hirt, Pete Fountain, Fats Domino, Chris Owens, Ronnie Cole, Louis Prima, Allen Toussaint, and Irma Thomas.
Tables, chairs, and sunshades are available for sitting down and listening to the Live Jazz Music that starts daily at 10:00 am until closing time. The Cafe Beignet can be found at the far side of the park, offering cold drinks, coffee, beignets, and small snacks.
The park also provides an educational venue for students in three New Orleans public schools, a venue for providing additional music education and performance opportunity for school children.  In the middle of the park you’ll find the “Pete’s Wishing Well Fountain.” The New Orleans Musical Legends Foundation donates money from this to the McDonogh Elementary School to provide band equipment."
